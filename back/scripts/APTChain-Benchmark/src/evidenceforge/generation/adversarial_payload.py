"""Adversarial-payload event CODE layer: synthesis, safety, per-surface encoding.

The COUNTERPART to ``generation/spillage.py``. Where spillage emits a provably-fake
*credential* and its safety contract FORBIDS control bytes (its docstring notes
that log-injection "is the separate ``adversarial_payload`` work"), this module
OWNS controlled injection of a log-pipeline weakness primitive (ANSI escape, CRLF
log-forging, CSV formula, JNDI/Log4Shell lookup, reflected-XSS markup) so defenders
can test that their parsers / SIEMs / shippers / terminals / CSV exports handle
untrusted log content safely.

The two reusable safety invariants are kept verbatim from spillage:
  * every rendered payload must carry a poison marker (``EFORGE_TEST`` by default),
    on EVERY physical line, so a CRLF split can never orphan an unmarked line; and
  * any host embedded in a payload must be the canary (``canary.eforge.invalid``,
    RFC 6761 reserved / non-resolving) or an RFC 2606/6761/5737/3849/1918 address —
    enforced by reusing spillage's hardened ``_extract_hosts`` / ``_host_allowed``.

What is INVERTED is the control-byte policy: instead of a blanket ban, a per-surface
encoder emits the weakness byte RAW only where the surface is the realistic
observation point (``syslog_message``), and escapes/percent-encodes it elsewhere so
it preserves the detection SIGNAL without corrupting an unrelated record.
