"""Spillage event CODE layer: synthesis, safety guardrails, per-surface encoding.

The credential *families* and safety *markers* are DATA and live in the
user-customizable overlay config (config/activity/secret_families.yaml). This
module is the CODE layer the maintainer asked for in
https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/EvidenceForge/issues/283 — it owns:

  * deterministic synthesis of one canonical fake value from a family,
  * the safety guardrails that prove every emitted value is synthetic, and
  * surface-appropriate encoding/rendering of that single canonical value.

Guardrails (enforced for both synthesized and user-supplied literal values, so
unsafe values never reach generation):

  1. Marker/allowlist — value contains a poison marker OR is a vendor-published
     fake. This is the hard "no real credential" guarantee.
  2. Host allowlist — any host embedded in a URL-shaped value is an RFC 2606 /
     RFC 6761 reserved domain or an RFC 5737 / RFC 3849 / RFC 1918 address.
     Alternate encodings a real client would undo (percent-encoding, Unicode
     label separators, obfuscated / zone-tagged IPs, backslash and scheme-relative
     URLs) are normalized first so a real host cannot hide behind one.
  3. Family regex — a value declared for a family must match that family's regex.
  4. Single-line / control-free — the value carries no CR/LF or other line
     separator (so a credential cannot be split across log lines) and no other
     control character such as ESC/NUL/BEL (so it cannot inject a terminal escape
     sequence or confuse a parser when rendered raw into a command line). Only tab
     is allowed. Spilling a credential is not a log-injection primitive; that is
     the separate `adversarial_payload` work.
