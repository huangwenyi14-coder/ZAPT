# Current-Dev Assessment Continuation

## Status

Active handoff memory for the current-dev realism assessment continuation that
was previously tracked directly in `TODO.md`.

The central roadmap now points here instead of carrying loop-by-loop status
updates. Continue appending concise handoff notes here if another assessment loop
or follow-up batch is needed.

## Current Handoff

- The previous TODO history recorded current-dev assessment loops through a long
  branch-era sequence, including the 143+ loop series and later follow-up batches.
- The latest recorded generator-owned targets included bash-history/process
  timing alignment, web/proxy path-template diversity, richer TLS/X.509 SAN
  distributions, and continued reduction of overly tidy scenario-authored names
  when scenario edits are in scope.
- Scenario-authored name legibility was repeatedly identified as a broad tell,
  but was deferred unless scenario edits were explicitly authorized.
- Preserve per-loop artifacts under the scenario or assessment output directory
  chosen for that loop; do not use `TODO.md` for loop transcripts.

## 2026-05-27 Loop Batch Notes

- Loop 200 fixed eCAR endpoint file texture and installed-software registry
  identity stability (`ed4ab68a`, `88db6b22`). Automated eval passed at
  96.66140704016262 over 78539 records; the hard probe saw 419 eCAR FILE events
  across all 15 hosts and zero duplicate installed-software DisplayName/GUID
  groups.
- Loop 200 blind review remained synthetic-leaning: initial synthetic-confidence
  average 59.0, deliberated average 64.75. The strongest confirmed next targets
  are proxy file-transfer object identity/timing and Linux eCAR process-to-flow
  attribution.
- Loop 201 fixed explicit-proxy HTTP file-transfer identity/timing by sharing
  origin-form content identity across proxy legs, pairing client/origin
  `files.log` metadata, and delaying client-facing file observation until after
  proxy-origin fetch observation. Automated eval passed at 95.83681405251764
  over 78513 records; the hard probe saw zero hash/size mismatches and both
  Dell updater client observations started/finished after origin observation.
  Blind synthetic-confidence scores were 72/68/67/76, average 70.75. Next
  target: AD account-management lifecycle ordering, with UDP/123/NTP contracts
  and built-in service-account profile paths queued behind it.
- Loop 202 fixed AD account-management lifecycle ordering by recording
  account-create effect times and delaying later same-host storyline commands
  and group-membership effects until after the prior AD audit effect is visible.
  Automated eval passed at 95.83680366637293 over 78514 records; the hard probe
  confirmed `net user`/4720 now precede `net group`/4728 for `svc_mhsync` in
  DC Security, Sysmon, and eCAR. Blind synthetic-confidence scores were
  68/76/72/74, average 72.50. Next target: canonical endpoint process/file
  ownership, especially service/kernel principals on user profile paths and
  Sysmon terminal-session inheritance.
- Loop 203 fixed service-principal endpoint profile artifacts and Sysmon
  terminal-session drift (`649fa9a6`). Automated eval passed at
  97.1909324170483 over 76333 records; the hard probe found zero service
  profile-path hits in eCAR/Sysmon, zero eCAR PID 4 interactive-profile
  contradictions, and zero Sysmon terminal-session drift cases. Blind scores
  were 68/55/44/72, average 59.75; deliberation final scores were
  72/66/50/76, average 66.00. Next target: eCAR process lifecycle ownership,
  especially module/process activity after native Security/Sysmon termination.
- Loop 204 fixed eCAR process lifecycle containment (`8f2881c2`, `2e9462a4`,
  `af62abd0`) by suppressing stale module loads after ended sessions, dropping
  or de-attributing stale eCAR process references after termination, and
  bounding parent/child termination repair so long-lived children do not drag
  parents hours forward. Automated eval passed at 96.7350560010721 over 78665
  records; the hard probe found zero eCAR modules, stale FLOW identities, or
  process terminates after matching Sysmon termination beyond the configured
  threshold. Blind scores were 47/64/35/52, average 49.50; deliberation final
  scores were 52/67/38/56, average 53.25. Next target: eCAR FILE
  source-native artifacts, especially Linux `/proc/<pid>/status` CREATE/WRITE
  rows and Windows Prefetch suffix morphology.
- Loop 205 fixed eCAR FILE source-native artifact pools (`2e86c4aa`) by moving
  Windows Prefetch templates to `{hex}` suffixes, removing generic Linux paths
  that could be paired with invalid churn actions, and adding `validate-config`
  guards for overlays. Automated eval passed at 96.83137893723699 over 76420
  records; the reviewer-finding probe confirmed zero decimal/non-hex Prefetch
  hits, zero Linux `/proc/<pid>/status` non-read hits, zero apache private-temp
  leaks, and zero service-principal `/etc/passwd` hits. Blind scores were
  42/38/64/63, average 51.75; deliberation final scores were 58/56/72/69,
  average 63.75. Next target: DNS source-native semantics, especially
  short-name/FQDN qtype behavior and resolver TTL modeling.
- Loop 206 fixed known internal DNS short-name semantics (`c95bd588`) by
  canonicalizing scenario host short names to internal FQDNs before resolver
  normalization and automatic lookup fan-out, and by rejecting MX owner context
  for single-label hostnames. Automated eval passed at 96.36440050584102 over
  78826 records; DNS probes confirmed zero internal short-name NOERROR rows,
  zero short-name MX rows, zero non-authoritative known internal FQDN rows, and
  zero public MX answers on internal names, with 7 remaining external RRset TTL
  increase cases inside 600 seconds. Blind scores were 28/36/68/66, average
  49.50; deliberation final scores were 58/61/72/70, average 65.25. The new
  highest-leverage target is TCP source-port lifecycle ownership: hard probes
  confirmed one same-sensor overlapping SMB 5-tuple in Zeek core and 32
  unmatched/stale eCAR FLOW examples after checking 9353 TCP flow rows.
- Loop 207 fixed SMB logon/transport ownership (`b7a9c0fa`) by binding
  companion Type 3 file-server logons to the just-emitted SMB transport source
  port and suppressing duplicate network evidence for that same session.
  Automated eval passed at 96.97058244405527 over 78480 records; hard probes
  confirmed zero same-sensor overlapping identical TCP tuple pairs and no
  recurrence of the loop-206 bad tuples. Valid blind scores were 48/30/34/33,
  average 36.25; deliberation final scores were 44/29/32/34, average 34.75.
  One initial detection review was discarded because the reviewer accidentally
  overwrote the frozen DC Security XML; the file was restored, data made
  read-only, and detection review rerun. The next target is texture rather than
  correctness: diversify Linux bash-history command pools by persona/role/host
  purpose and reduce exact-hour update/proxy/package traffic alignment.
- Loop 208 fixed exact Linux shell diagnostic repetition (`ca6ebca6`) by
  replacing broad exact diagnostic commands in the bash YAML pools, adding
  low-repeat command-family caps, and routing legacy activity-key shell commands
  through the shared command-memory selector. Automated eval passed at
  96.90138712062229 over 75650 records; rendered probes confirmed exact
  reviewer-cited command hits dropped from 30 in loop 207 to 1 in loop 208 and
  recent DNS/TCP tuple regression probes stayed clean. Blind scores were
  46/53/47/58, average 51.00. No deliberation was triggered because all
  reviewers agreed on Synthetic and score spread was small. The next
  highest-leverage target is Linux session semantics: reduce repeated named-user
  SSH fan-out across production Linux systems and eliminate unsupported generic
  eCAR `remote` successful sessions unless source-native SSH/PAM companion
  evidence exists.
- Loop 209 fixed Linux remote-session noise (`67bec768`) by keeping generic
  baseline Linux logon activity local/service, reducing organic SSH fan-out, and
  thinning ambient SSH noise while preserving SSH-bundle-owned remote sessions.
  Automated eval passed at 97.42953794362485 over 75679 records; rendered
  probes confirmed successful generic Linux `remote` eCAR sessions dropped from
  4 to 0 and successful SSH sessions dropped from 221 to 83. Blind scores were
  47/51/50/45, average 48.25. No deliberation was triggered because all
  reviewers agreed on Synthetic and score spread was small. The next
  highest-leverage target is multi-sensor Zeek timing texture: add per-sensor
  clock offset/drift, broader capture jitter, occasional missing companions, and
  packet-accounting variance.
- Loop 210 fixed multi-sensor Zeek timing texture (`f2b1c34b`) by widening
  flow-local sensor path-delay jitter inside configured timing bounds so
  duplicated core/DMZ observations no longer imply one fixed positive tap order.
  Automated eval passed at 97.42953794362485 over 75679 records; rendered probes
  showed paired core/DMZ conn offsets move from 1 negative / 2271 positive rows
  in loop 209 to 805 negative / 1467 positive rows in loop 210, with rounded
  offset buckets increasing from 25 to 91. Blind scores were 47/51/42/46,
  average 46.50. No deliberation was triggered because all reviewers agreed on
  Synthetic and score spread was small. The next highest-leverage target is
  Windows explicit-credential 4648 source/target semantics, with shell workflow
  texture close behind.
- Loop 211 fixed Windows explicit-credential 4648 source semantics (`c2c6a344`)
  by omitting synthetic local-host network endpoints from source-side 4648
  records while preserving authored modeled remote origins. Automated eval
  passed at 96.29214042141777 over 73942 records; the rendered probe showed
  loop 210 had 31/31 remote 4648 rows using the reporting host IP as
  `NetworkAddress`, while loop 211 had zero local-host-IP 4648 network
  addresses and only the authored attacker origin remained nonblank. Blind
  scores were 56/31/42/42, average 42.75. Deliberation was triggered by verdict
  disagreement and ended Inconclusive with final scores 50/38/42/44, average
  43.50. The next highest-leverage target is Windows remote-execution lifecycle
  texture, especially long-lived PsExec parentage and audit-log-clear 1102
  subject rendering.
- Loop 212 fixed Windows PsExec remote-execution lifecycle texture (`0ad5983c`,
  `b725f912`) by bounding `PSEXESVC.exe` lifetime, expiring stale PsExec service
  context, and emitting explicit wrapper termination. Automated eval passed at
  96.39589873896136 over 74657 records; the rendered probe showed loop 211 had
  8 PSEXESVC-parented child processes, 7 late children after two minutes, no
  termination, and 6 monitored later commands parented by PsExec, while loop
  212 had one immediate PsExec child, one termination, zero late children, and
  zero monitored later commands parented by PsExec. Blind scores were
  78/86/91/86, average 85.25. No deliberation was triggered because all
  reviewers agreed on Synthetic. The next highest-leverage target is endpoint
  source-native consistency, especially Windows Security channel `EventRecordID`
  monotonicity after log clear and eCAR FLOW/session/process lifecycle timing and
  identity pairing.
- Loop 213 fixed Windows Security channel `EventRecordID` monotonicity
  (`9ce3ad27`) by removing the renderer reset on Event ID 1102 while preserving
  the 1102 event. Automated eval passed at 96.39589873896136 over 74657 records;
  the rendered probe showed loop 212 had one non-increasing/decreasing Security
  record-ID transition on DC-01, from Event ID 4688 record `11619147` to Event
  ID 1102 record `2`, while loop 213 had zero non-increasing record IDs across
  7044 Security rows and still had one 1102 row. Blind scores were
  86/88/86/88, average 87.00. No deliberation was triggered because all
  reviewers agreed on Synthetic. The next highest-leverage target is
  source-observation realism for endpoint/network/proxy correlations: reduce
  same-second eCAR FLOW/Zeek/proxy completeness with realistic jitter, dropout,
  caching, and source-specific visibility gaps while preserving huntable pivots.
- Loop 214 fixed eCAR FLOW source-observation timing texture (`9895f149`) by
  widening the data-driven `source.ecar_flow` latency profile from 40-300ms to
  180-1800ms while preserving connection-interval clamps and remote-session FLOW
  ordering tests. Automated eval passed at 96.39580305774429 over 74653 records;
  the hard probe matched 13565 eCAR FLOW rows to Zeek tuples in both loop 213 and
  loop 214, with same-second matches dropping from 66.31% to 43.84%, within-one-
  second matches dropping from 99.42% to 70.61%, and p90 delta moving from
  0.573s to 1.649s. Blind scores were 68/64/67/74, average 68.25. No
  deliberation was triggered because all reviewers agreed on Synthetic and score
  spread was 10 points. The next highest-leverage targets are eCAR Linux
  local-session durability and file/process ownership, TLSv1.2 resumed-handshake
  consistency across `resumed`/`ssl_history`/certificate FUIDs, and Windows
  source-native texture for Defender paths and Sysmon `ProcessGuid` shape.

- Loop 215 fixed eCAR Linux local-session durability and generic Linux FILE
  ownership (`e8ea4deb`) by reusing active same-user local Linux sessions and
  removing Apache access-log paths from generic eCAR file churn. Automated eval
  passed at 96.58483954300257 over 69503 records; the hard probe showed
  `WS-LNGUYEN-01/lina.nguyen` successful local logins dropped from 12 to 1,
  max duplicate local-login groups dropped from 12 to 2, and generic
  `/var/log/apache2/access.log` FILE rows dropped from 24 to 0. Blind scores
  were 63/66/32/43, average 51.00; deliberation final scores were
  66/68/45/56, average 58.75. The next highest-leverage target is Linux shell
  pipeline process overlap: probe confirmed 10 of 10 visible two-stage pipeline
  commands had non-overlapping eCAR process lifetimes, with WEB-EXT LDAP stale
  endpoint/Zeek tuple ownership queued behind it.

- Loop 216 fixed eCAR Linux shell pipeline process concurrency (`fd786afc`) by
  grouping near-simultaneous same-shell foreground creates during eCAR timing
  normalization while preserving serialization for separate foreground
  commands. Automated eval passed at 96.58483954300257 over 69503 records; the
  hard probe showed visible two-stage pipeline non-overlap dropped from 10/10 in
  loop 215 to 0/10 in loop 216. Blind scores were 38/32/36/43, average 37.25.
  No deliberation was triggered because reviewers clustered in
  mostly-realistic, mixed, or inconclusive territory with an 11-point score
  spread. The next highest-leverage target is remote-session and receiver-side
  file-transfer ordering, especially RDP login-before-endpoint-flow and SCP
  receiver file-before-SSH/session evidence.

- Loop 217 fixed remote-session and receiver-side file-transfer ordering
  (`70351fe7`, `057db70b`) by clamping SSH/RDP target logins after matching
  inbound eCAR FLOW evidence, recording SSH session readiness for SCP receiver
  file timing, and making recent explicit SSH source-port reservations
  idempotent. Automated eval passed at 96.29905741773004 over 70577 records; the
  hard probe confirmed zero SCP file-before-readiness violations, shared
  source-port `57349` across Zeek/eCAR/syslog for the DB-to-APP SCP transfer,
  and zero RDP target-login-before-flow inversions, with one target-side RDP
  FLOW collection-gap note. Blind initial scores were 56/48/34/64, average
  50.50; deliberation was triggered by verdict disagreement and produced final
  scores 58/50/38/62, average 52.00. The highest-leverage next target is
  host-source texture: DC remote-admin command parentage through concrete
  execution owners and high-frequency Linux journald runtime-size filler.

- Loop 218 was a fresh post-merge `dev` assessment with no code changes in the
  loop. Automated eval passed at 96.29905741773004 over 70577 records. Blind
  initial scores were 43/43/68/64, average 54.50; deliberation was triggered by
  verdict disagreement and produced final scores 48/58/72/66, average 61.00.
  The dominant new finding is a DB-to-DC LDAP lifecycle contradiction: four
  DB-PROD-01 eCAR `ldapsearch` FLOW rows at 17:50-17:51 reused exact LDAP source
  ports that Zeek and DC endpoint telemetry already observed at 15:25-16:31.
  Secondary targets are RDP target Security 4624 evidence preceding target eCAR
  inbound FLOW for matching tuples, over-sampled Windows maintenance process
  texture, and the previously noted DC remote-admin command parentage.

- Loop 219 fixed stale endpoint FLOW process attribution by keeping eCAR FLOW
  rows bounded to canonical connection timing and dropping PID/actor attribution
  when the visible process create is too late to claim the flow. It also added a
  same-day exact 5-tuple reuse guard in the source-port allocator. Automated eval
  passed at 96.29905741773004 over 70577 records; the hard probe showed 5
  DB-PROD-01 to DC-01 LDAP eCAR FLOW rows, 5 matching Zeek rows, and zero late
  attributed exact-tuple matches over 60 seconds apart. Blind initial scores were
  62/44/28/68, average 50.50; deliberation produced final scores 64/52/36/70,
  average 55.50. The next highest-leverage target is Linux host/auth texture:
  per-host UID ownership collisions, overproduced `unattended-upgr` chatter, and
  excess direct `pam_unix(login:session)` local/root/admin sessions on servers.

- Loop 220 fixed the Linux host/auth texture family by assigning named Linux
  users non-default UID ranges, repairing same-host PAM UID collisions at syslog
  finalization, capping `unattended-upgr` filler to 8 rows per host/window, and
  reducing server local-console login noise. Automated eval passed at
  96.88614699870703 over 69207 records; the probe showed zero same-host PAM UID
  collisions, max 8 `unattended-upgr` rows per host, and sharply reduced server
  local login rows. Blind initial scores were 28/34/30/66, average 39.50;
  deliberation produced final scores 46/48/42/66, average 50.50. The next
  highest-leverage target is an APP-INT SSH lifecycle contradiction: a root SSH
  shell/session tied to `10.10.3.10:47995 -> 10.10.2.30:22` continued producing
  eCAR child process/logout evidence hours after the matching Zeek TCP/22 flow
  closed.

- Loop 221 fixed the Linux SSH storyline lifecycle family by preventing reuse of
  recorded SSH sessions after transport close, rejecting closed SSH shells for
  later process parents, extending SSH transports when future authored logoffs
  need the session to remain open, and preserving in-window storyline logoffs
  while clamping genuinely late logoffs to transport close. Automated eval
  passed at 96.44916777020666 over 76731 records; the probe showed the APP-INT
  root SSH FLOW, LOGIN, cleanup process, and LOGOUT all share a transport that
  remains open through the cleanup/logoff window. Blind initial scores were
  57/42/34/67, average 50.00; deliberation produced final scores 68/60/47/72,
  average 61.75. The next highest-leverage target is Windows outbound SMB
  network-logon ownership: client workstations emit local Type 3/self-IP logons
  and eCAR USER_SESSION rows for outbound SMB while the file server also records
  the correct remote Type 3 logon.

- Loop 222 fixed human Windows Type 3 network-logon source ownership by making
  ambient/direct successful Type 3 logons choose a real remote source when the
  environment inventory supports it, or downgrade to local interactive semantics
  instead of fabricating a human self-IP/port-0 network session. It also removed
  the successful Type 3 `NtLmSsp`/`Negotiate`/`LmPackageName=-` auth tuple in
  favor of NTLM V2. Automated eval passed at 96.9222107992763 over 72722
  records; hard probes found zero human/admin successful Type 3 self-IP
  `IpPort=0` rows and zero human eCAR Type 3 `USER_SESSION LOGIN` rows with
  `src_ip:"-"`. Blind scores were 48/36/49/46, average 44.75; no deliberation
  was triggered because all reviewers returned Inconclusive. Next targets are
  TLS/X.509 CA-chain validity bounds, endpoint collection timing texture, and
  broader scenario/noise messiness.

- Loop 223 fixed TLS/X.509 chain-validity contradictions by correcting public
  CA authority profiles so configured intermediates no longer outlive their
  roots, moving Cloudflare ECC issuance under the configured Cloudflare ECC
  root, adding config validation for child-CA windows versus parent issuer
  windows, and clamping generated leaf/intermediate validity to configured
  issuer validity. Focused cert/config tests, Ruff checks, and
  `uv run eforge validate-config` passed. Automated eval stayed at
  96.9222107992763 over 72722 records; the hard probe found 718 rendered
  X.509 rows and zero parent-window violations. Blind scores were 42/39/43/45,
  average 42.25, all Inconclusive; network forensics explicitly called TLS
  varied and credible. Next targets are source-native network byte/accounting
  texture, especially NTP payload sizing, DHCP byte-size invariance, and one
  HTTP response-body total exceeding Zeek connection payload accounting.

- Loop 224 fixed source-native network byte/accounting texture by clamping
  NTP payload accounting to realistic UDP/123 message sizes, varying DHCP
  request/response payload buckets by host and message type, and making Zeek
  connection accounting honor flow-level HTTP body totals for reused HTTP UIDs.
  Focused NTP/DHCP/HTTP body-floor tests and Ruff checks passed. Automated eval
  stayed at 96.9222107992763 over 72722 records; hard probes found NTP payloads
  bounded to 144/124 bytes, 28 distinct DHCP byte-size buckets across 28 rows,
  and zero HTTP body-budget violations. Initial blind scores were 66/35/62/42,
  average 51.25; deliberation was triggered by mixed verdicts and a 31-point
  spread, producing final scores 68/48/64/52, average 58.00. The strongest next
  target is HTTP binary-transfer realism: successful `.msi`/`.zip` proxy/Zeek
  downloads rendered as `200 application/octet-stream` with only 23-38 KB
  bodies and no coherent Zeek file-transfer evidence.

- Loop 225 fixed HTTP binary-transfer realism by teaching shared HTTP content
  helpers to infer installer/archive/package MIME types from `.msi`, `.msp`,
  `.zip`, `.deb`, and `.rpm` paths and size them at download scale. Focused
  HTTP helper and explicit-proxy file-transfer tests plus Ruff checks passed.
  Automated eval passed at 96.77569096689754 over 72405 records; hard probes
  found 6 MSI/ZIP-style HTTP rows, zero tiny successful binary-body violations,
  zero missing `resp_fuids` references, 2 proxy binary rows, and zero tiny proxy
  binary rows. Initial blind scores were 38/61/42/68, average 52.25;
  deliberation was triggered by mixed verdicts and a 30-point spread, producing
  final scores 46/64/48/70, average 57.00. The next highest-leverage target is
  Linux interactive session ownership/timing: `WS-LNGUYEN-01` developer
  workflows are anchored to cron/local session semantics with near-zero
  shell-to-command think time and short editor lifetimes. Public PTR realism is
  next behind it.

- Loop 226 fixed Linux interactive session ownership/timing by preventing
  syslog logind PAM backfill from labeling human local sessions as cron,
  adding shell-readiness gaps before first foreground children, and treating
  Linux `code`/`codium` launches as long-lived GUI editors rather than
  short-lived foreground commands. Focused syslog/activity/world-model tests,
  scenario validation, Ruff checks, and rendered probes passed. Automated eval
  passed at 96.47672953376664 over 72989 records; hard probes found zero human
  `cron:session` PAM opens, a minimum human shell-to-child gap of 11806 ms
  across 82 pairs, and zero short `code` terminations. Initial blind scores
  were 66/55/42/67, average 57.50; deliberation produced final scores
  70/62/48/72, average 63.00. The next highest-leverage target is the sibling
  Linux SSH endpoint ownership defect: outbound TCP/22 client flows on Linux
  hosts are attributed to long-running `sshd` listener PIDs instead of
  `/usr/bin/ssh`, `/usr/bin/scp`, or the invoking shell.

- Loop 227 fixed the sibling Linux SSH endpoint ownership defect by
  materializing source-side `/usr/bin/ssh` or `/usr/bin/scp` processes for SSH
  bundle transports and suppressing generic Linux outbound TCP/22 attribution to
  local `sshd` listener PIDs when no explicit client process is known. Focused
  SSH/world-model/activity tests, scenario validation, Ruff checks, and rendered
  probes passed; the hard probe found 101 outbound TCP/22 flows, zero `sshd`
  owner hits, and 34 explicit ssh/scp client-owned rows. Automated eval passed
  at 96.74526439145288 over 76230 records. Initial blind scores were
  62/61/43/62, average 57.00; deliberation final scores were 63/64/45/66,
  average 59.50. The next highest-leverage targets are Windows source-native
  metadata and coverage texture: Security/Sysmon `EventRecordID` gap bands,
  outbound-only 5156 direction coverage, and Sysmon/Security process timing
  bias.

- Loop 228 fixed Windows Security/Sysmon `EventRecordID` texture by replacing
  bounded renderer gap buckets with a shared per-host/per-channel sequence model
  that includes elapsed-time hidden activity, mid-range gaps, and occasional
  large filtered-channel jumps. Focused record-ID/emitter tests, Ruff checks,
  scenario validation, generation, and rendered probes passed; the rendered
  probe found Security now has 1946 gaps in the 9-40 range, 280 gaps over 200,
  and max gap 17933, while Sysmon has 925 gaps in the 9-40 range, 155 gaps over
  200, and max gap 7407. Automated eval passed at 96.74526439145288 over 76230
  records. Initial blind scores were 64/42/38/43, average 46.75; deliberation
  final scores were 58/44/40/46, average 47.00. No reviewer repeated the prior
  EventRecordID finding. The next highest-leverage target is a concrete
  web/endpoint contract gap: add source-native web-access precursor evidence
  around service-user reverse-shell process creation, with eCAR/Sysmon timing
  texture next behind it.

- Loop 229 first hard-probed the loop-228 web/endpoint precursor claim and
  found it was a false positive: `WEB-EXT-01` has a same-second
  `POST /ehr/admin/upload.php` web-access row for the service-user reverse-shell
  process creation. The loop then fixed the verified eCAR/Sysmon process-create
  timing texture by widening `source.ecar_after_sysmon_process_create_gap` in
  the data-driven timing profile. Focused timing/config tests, Ruff checks,
  config validation, scenario validation, generation, and rendered probes
  passed; the hard probe moved exact Sysmon/eCAR process-create deltas from a
  loop-228 median of 0.28s and max 1.45s to a loop-229 median of 1.81s, p90
  3.25s, and 136 matches over 3s while preserving ordering. Automated eval
  passed at 96.83950751584356 over 75311 records. Initial blind scores were
  46/67/74/64, average 62.75; deliberation final scores were 62/70/76/68,
  average 69.00. The timing fix was not criticized; reviewers instead converged
  on a new highest-leverage hard contradiction: proxy-origin TLS byte/packet
  accounting diverges from ASA teardown bytes for same tuples, with Linux
  journald filler, public IP role reuse, repeated Windows maintenance/RDP
  density, and polished intrusion-path texture queued behind it.

- Loop 230 fixed proxy-origin TLS byte/packet accounting by sizing canonical
  TLS transport bytes from HTTP flow-level request/response body budgets and
  updating connection state after TCP SF normalization. Focused activity tests,
  Ruff checks, scenario validation, generation, and rendered probes passed; the
  hard probe moved large Zeek-greater-than-ASA mismatches from 75 to 0 and bad
  payload-per-packet rows from 34 to 0 across matched teardowns. Automated eval
  passed at 95.35415427133147 over 80189 records. Initial blind scores were
  64/38/34/55, average 47.75; deliberation final scores were 67/44/38/60,
  average 52.25. The previous hard proxy/TLS accounting contradiction was not
  repeated. The next highest-leverage targets are behavioral texture: large
  upload endpoint staging evidence, dense regular-user RDP/DC sessions, generic
  Linux/eCAR temp paths, exact-hour proxy bursts with inconsistent User-Agent
  families, and overly clean network collection.

- Loop 231 fixed dense baseline RDP session texture by capping domain-controller
  RDP noise to one considered session per hour, sorting candidate sessions
  chronologically, selecting the source workstation up front, and applying a
  same source/user/target cooldown keyed to the actual materialized session
  start. Focused RDP tests, Ruff checks, scenario validation, generation, and
  rendered probes passed; the hard probe moved `mstsc.exe` creates from 38 to
  14, DC-01 targets from 27 to 7, and the maximum two-minute
  same-source/user/target cluster from 5 to 1. Automated eval passed at
  96.6902301042063 over 74252 records. Initial blind scores were 47/38/31/34,
  average 37.50; deliberation final scores were 44/40/34/36, average 38.50.
  The prior RDP/DC tell was inverted into positive host evidence. The next
  highest-leverage targets are Security 1102 native EventData, operational
  roughness around the `svc_mhsync` attack path, host-specific sysstat/cron and
  top-of-hour scheduling texture, and eCAR FLOW actor semantics.

- Loop 232 fixed the verified Linux sysstat CRON cadence tell by honoring
  configured `slot_jitter_seconds` for cron schedules while keeping
  unconfigured cron schedules minute-aligned. Focused scheduler tests, Ruff,
  config validation, scenario validation, generation, and rendered probes
  passed; the probe moved sysstat rows at second `00` from 66/66 in loop 231 to
  2/66 in loop 232, with zero exact half-hour boundary rows. Automated eval
  passed at 96.52362201870753 over 75598 records. Blind scores were
  61/57/58/49, average 56.25, with no deliberation because all reviewers agreed
  on Synthetic and the score spread was 12. The next highest-leverage targets
  are broad SSH/admin access and scenario roughness, Windows remote-exec/service
  staging semantics, public web-client persona stability plus DNS TTL texture,
  and endpoint software inventory/registry churn. A full non-slow pytest run
  still had unrelated broader failures in existing storyline/session, TLS-chain,
  nmap, baseline failure-rate, and foreground-process timing tests.

- Loop 233 fixed generic external web-client persona instability by reserving
  scanner/authored external source IPs away from ordinary baseline web clients
  and making external visitor profile selection sticky per source IP. Focused
  web-access tests, Ruff, config validation, scenario validation, generation,
  and rendered probes passed; the probe moved generic mixed external web-client
  IPs from 8 in loop 232 to 0 in loop 233, with the only remaining mixed source
  being authored storyline IP `185.70.41.45`. Automated eval passed at
  97.17049896473532 over 74239 records. Blind scores were 58/64/32/63, average
  54.25. Network review improved to Mostly realistic with no hard network
  contradictions; the next highest-leverage target is Linux eCAR attaching
  privileged apt/dpkg file writes to non-root daemon principals, followed by
  Windows utility runtimes, Linux eCAR pid/tid texture, SSH eCAR session tuple
  symmetry, repeated LDAP discovery commands, and polished attack-storyline
  semantics.

- Loop 234 fixed Linux eCAR privileged package-state ownership by removing
  package-manager state paths from generic Linux FILE churn and filtering
  root-owned apt/dpkg/dnf paths away from non-root principals in the
  process-aware side-effect helper. Focused EDR/config tests, Ruff, config
  validation, scenario validation, generation, and rendered probes passed; the
  probe moved non-root privileged package FILE events from 17 in loop 233 to 0
  in loop 234. Automated eval passed at 97.09115240170016 over 74508 records.
  Initial blind scores were 31/29/44/37, average 35.25; deliberation final
  scores were 38/36/47/39, average 40.0. Detection and Host/EDR both flipped to
  Real and the previous apt/dpkg contradiction was not repeated. The next
  highest-leverage target is public-domain HTTP/proxy protocol policy plus
  host-role constraints for workstation-style proxy/update traffic on server
  roles, followed by SSH command-to-flow timing, eCAR principal/timing texture,
  bash-history monotonicity, scanner cadence, and Windows utility lifetimes.

- Loop 235 fixed public-domain HTTP/proxy protocol policy and host-role
  constraints for workstation-style proxy/update traffic by adding
  source-system-type filtering to proxy URI, DNS, TLS, world-model, and
  baseline destination selection, marking workstation update/sync domains as
  workstation-only, and applying HTTPS-first plaintext redirect policy before
  explicit proxy routing. Focused proxy/domain/config tests, Ruff checks,
  config validation, scenario validation, generation, and rendered probes
  passed; the hard probe moved HTTPS-first plaintext HTTP `200` responses from
  53 in loop 234 to 0 in loop 235 and DC-originated consumer/update proxy rows
  from 22 to 0. Automated eval passed at 95.46721057150579 over 86450 records.
  Initial blind scores were 56/38/63/32, average 47.25; deliberation final
  scores were 60/45/65/42, average 53.0. The targeted public-HTTP/DC-role
  defects were not repeated. The next highest-leverage target is binding
  OCSP/certificate revocation status to proxy/TLS inspection outcomes so
  revoked certificate evidence cannot coexist with repeated clean
  SSL-inspected HTTP `200` responses unless policy-exception telemetry explains
  the outcome; proxy endpoint identity semantics are the next sibling target.

- Loop 236 fixed the OCSP/proxy revocation contradiction by allowing successful
  HTTP-backed TLS activity to suppress revoked OCSP statuses and by suppressing
  mainstream Adobe telemetry revocation false positives in TLS realism config.
  Focused OCSP tests, Ruff checks, config validation, scenario validation,
  generation, and rendered probes passed; the hard probe moved revoked
  `assets.adobedtm.com` leaf evidence and clean SSL-inspected `200` responses
  for revoked hosts from present in loop 235 to zero in loop 236. Automated eval
  passed at 95.46721057150579 over 86450 records. Blind scores were
  56/47/69/68, average 60.0, with no deliberation because all reviewers agreed
  on Synthetic and the score spread was 22. The targeted OCSP/proxy defect was
  not repeated. The next highest-leverage target is the hard endpoint/network
  causality contradiction where eCAR `FLOW` rows and process attribution can
  appear after the matching Zeek tuple has already started or closed; Windows
  Security/Sysmon `EventRecordID` hidden-volume pairing realism is the next
  close target.

- Loop 237 fixed the hard eCAR/Zeek endpoint-network causality contradiction by
  keeping eCAR `FLOW/CONNECT` rows at network-observation time and dropping
  unsafe process identity when visible process timing would require shifting the
  flow after the matching Zeek tuple close. It also prefers stable SSH/RDP
  listener PIDs for inbound transport ownership instead of late per-session
  child PIDs. Focused eCAR/source-timing tests, Ruff checks, scenario
  validation, generation, hard probes, and automated eval passed. The hard probe
  moved identified process-create-after-Zeek-close cases from 6 in loop 236 to
  0 in loop 237, while process-create-after-Zeek-start cases dropped from 41 to
  4 and remained inside open intervals. Automated eval passed at
  95.46721057150579 over 86450 records. Initial blind scores were 52/34/24/44,
  average 38.5; deliberation final scores were 48/34/30/44, average 39.0.
  Network flipped to Real before deliberation and explicitly found no impossible
  endpoint/network ordering. The next highest-leverage target is Linux
  bash-history/session alignment: commands for `lina.nguyen` continue after all
  visible SSH sessions close on `DB-PROD-01` and `WEB-EXT-01`; Windows inbound
  endpoint network telemetry is the next broad source-shape target.

- Loop 238 fixed Linux bash-history/session alignment by fitting bash-history
  timestamps into concrete visible Linux sessions, suppressing commands that
  cannot be owned by an active/recent session, updating Linux SSH client session
  activity, and extending Linux SSH baseline sessions through the hour they
  serve. Focused activity/world-model tests, Ruff checks, scenario validation,
  generation, hard probes, automated eval, and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov`
  suite passed. The hard probe found 202 checked bash commands with zero outside
  syslog/eCAR session intervals. Automated eval passed at 95.808647580328 over
  83833 records. Initial blind scores were 62/66/46/64, average 59.5;
  deliberation final average was 62.5. Host/EDR explicitly called Linux SSH
  ordering a strength. A sidecar read-only scenario-authoredness review found
  recurring Threat Hunter feedback clusters around textbook linear kill chain,
  compressed six-hour window, analyst-readable artifacts, low operator friction,
  and bounded background entropy; scenario edits are deferred per user request.

- Loop 239 fixed Windows process lifecycle and Security/Sysmon process-create
  source timing by coupling Security 4688 to the matching Sysmon Event 1 through
  source timing constraints and replacing hour-centered Windows stale-process
  cleanup with application-class bounded/heavy-tailed lifetimes. Focused tests,
  Ruff checks, scenario validation, generation, hard probes, automated eval, and
  the full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed with 3916 passed and 18 skipped.
  The hard probe moved Security-before-Sysmon process-create inversions from
  226 in loop 238 to 0 and over-1000ms process-create gaps from 459 to 0.
  Automated eval passed at 96.33355975624633 over 84473 records. Blind scores
  were 58/35/56/42, average 47.75, with no deliberation because all reviewers
  returned Inconclusive. The next highest-leverage target is public external IP
  role separation across scanner pools, benign destinations, NTP/STUN, and
  suspicious direct-IP activity; Windows endpoint inbound/egress collection
  asymmetry and eCAR session-before-flow timing are close follow-ups.

- Loop 240 fixed public external IP role separation by routing baseline outbound
  IDS false-positive destinations through a deterministic outbound-destination
  pool that excludes external scanner IPs, explicit external storyline sources,
  and public NTP IPs. Focused baseline/network tests, Ruff checks, scenario
  validation, generation, automated eval, and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov`
  suite passed with 3917 passed and 18 skipped. The hard probe moved
  scanner/destination collisions from 7 in loop 239 to 0. Automated eval passed
  at 95.94966202503336 over 82736 records. Blind scores were 68/72/32/74,
  average 61.5. Network Forensics scored Realistic and explicitly praised role
  consistency and proxy pivots; Threat Hunter and Detection Engineering again
  centered scenario-authoredness (textbook kill chain, signposted C2/exfil,
  clean domain-compromise sequence). Host/EDR found the next engine target:
  Linux eCAR source-native semantics, especially `pid == tid`, row-level
  principal visibility toggling for the same daemon/PID, and a remaining
  bash-history/session ownership gap.

- Loop 241 fixed Linux eCAR source-native semantics by varying Linux TIDs
  instead of mirroring PID for almost every event, making FLOW principal
  visibility stable for the same host/process/direction, preserving rebased
  PID/TID morphology, and suppressing unowned Linux server SSH-client or
  bash-history evidence in full scenario generation. Focused eCAR/activity
  tests, Ruff checks, scenario validation, generation, automated eval, and the
  full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed with 3923 passed and 18 skipped.
  The hard probe moved Linux `pid == tid` rows from 100.0% in loop 240 to 6.5%,
  FLOW principal toggle groups from 27 to 0, all bash-history outside visible
  eCAR sessions from 25 to 17, and SSH/SCP bash-history outside visible eCAR
  sessions from 6 to 4. Automated eval passed at 95.37754385363799 over 78485
  records. Blind scores were 34/32/30/38, average 33.5, with all four reviewers
  scoring Realistic. Next highest-leverage target is perimeter scan service/role
  consistency, especially successful public DNS/PostgreSQL-style probes against
  WEB-EXT without matching service/protocol/host evidence. IDS/application
  detection richness and endpoint software inventory lifecycle are strong
  follow-ups. Scenario-authoredness findings remain deferred per user request.

- Loop 242 fixed perimeter scan service/role consistency by making baseline
  inbound IDS false-positive companions and authored external port-scan
  expansion honor public service exposure and firewall deny policy. Unpermitted
  or unexposed public TCP ports now render as denied, reset, or no-response
  traffic instead of successful handshakes with invented services. Focused
  baseline/storyline tests, Ruff checks, scenario validation, generation,
  automated eval, hard probes, and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite
  passed with 3927 passed and 18 skipped. The hard probe moved successful
  external inbound handshakes to unpermitted public `WEB-EXT` ports from 7 in
  loop 241 to 0, TCP/53 successful probe rows without parsed DNS companions
  from 2 to 0, and ASA successful teardowns for those unpermitted ports from 7
  to 0. Automated eval passed at 96.17723878448457 over 79418 records. Blind
  scores were 31/34/34/55, average 38.5. The targeted public-service exposure
  issue did not recur; Network Forensics instead called out proxy
  User-Agent/domain binding and narrow ASA/Snort texture. The next
  highest-leverage target is eCAR FILE/REGISTRY/FLOW source-native provenance
  and source-observation asymmetry across Security/Sysmon/eCAR. Scenario
  staging/polish findings remain deferred per user request.

- Loop 243 fixed eCAR FILE/REGISTRY/FLOW source-native provenance by copying
  known process image and command line from canonical `ProcessContext` onto
  dependent eCAR rows when process identity is timing-safe, while preserving
  stale-flow identity scrubbing. Focused eCAR tests, Ruff checks, scenario
  validation, generation, automated eval, hard probes, and the full
  `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed with 3929 passed and 18 skipped. The
  hard probe moved PID-bearing eCAR image-path coverage for FILE, REGISTRY, and
  FLOW from 0% in loop 242 to 100% in loop 243; command-line coverage reached
  98.03% for FILE, 100% for REGISTRY, and 92.15% for FLOW. Automated eval
  passed at 96.78792550789055 over 79418 records. Blind scores were
  68/72/31/47, average 54.5 under the stricter full briefing. The targeted
  provenance gap improved, but Threat Hunter and Detection Engineering surfaced
  a sharper source-native ownership defect: proxy HTTP flows with apt/curl/wget/
  python/browser User-Agents are attributed to incompatible processes such as
  `/bin/bash`, `git status`, Webex, or Slack. That process-to-proxy ownership
  family is the next highest-leverage target. Linux journald filler volume is
  the next host texture target. Scenario-authoredness remains deferred per user
  request.

- Loop 244 fixed explicit-proxy endpoint process ownership by making the proxy
  transaction / network action path replace or scrub incompatible source-side
  process identity for browser, package-manager, curl/wget, python, Java, Go,
  and PowerShell User-Agent families, and by scoping CONNECT tunnel reuse by
  User-Agent. Focused explicit-proxy tests, Ruff checks, scenario validation,
  generation, automated eval, hard probes, and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov`
  suite passed with 3938 passed and 18 skipped. The corrected hard probe
  matched only source-side `OUTBOUND` eCAR FLOW rows to Zeek HTTP proxy tuples
  and found 0 incompatible process owners across 2120 matched outbound proxy
  rows; 1913 rows carried compatible process identity and 207 safely omitted
  process identity. Automated eval passed at 96.89339473777208 over 78405
  records. Blind scores were 37/34/38/62, average 42.75. The targeted
  proxy-process defect did not recur; Threat Hunter and Detection Engineering
  both moved to Inconclusive. The next highest-leverage engine target is Sysmon
  `ProcessGuid` morphology, with DNS TTL/rtt texture and eCAR logout context as
  close follow-ups. Scenario-authoredness remains deferred per user request.

- Loop 245 fixed Sysmon `ProcessGuid` morphology in the Sysmon emitter while
  preserving stable process correlation across Event 1/3/5/7/8/10/11/13/22.
  Focused Sysmon ProcessGuid tests, broader Sysmon/Snare tests, Ruff checks,
  scenario validation, generation, automated eval, hard probes, and the full
  `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed with 3938 passed and 18 skipped. The
  hard probe moved UUID-like/random-tail Sysmon process GUID references from
  5313 in loop 244 to 0 in loop 245, with 5313 native-shape references and all
  792 Event 1 timestamp-word matches preserved. Automated eval passed at
  96.89339473777208 over 78405 records. Blind scores were 54/76/36/38, average
  51.0. The targeted Sysmon GUID morphology issue did not recur; Host/EDR moved
  from Synthetic at 62 to Inconclusive at 38. The next highest-leverage engine
  target is cross-source process lifecycle ordering, where Detection Engineering
  found a DC-01 `python.exe` Security 4689 termination before later same-guid
  Sysmon Event 3 telemetry, and Threat Hunter found related eCAR remote-thread
  evidence trailing attacker process termination. Scenario-authoredness remains
  deferred per user request.

- Loop 246 fixed cross-source Windows process lifecycle ordering by extending
  the Windows Security lifecycle fixup so Security 4689 process terminations
  render after later same-process WFP 5156 dependents in both buffered and
  spooled paths. Focused Windows lifecycle tests, broader Windows/timing tests,
  config validation, Ruff checks, scenario validation, generation, automated
  eval, hard probes, and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed with
  3940 passed and 18 skipped. The hard probe moved Security 4689 before later
  same-process WFP 5156 from 1 in loop 245 to 0 in loop 246, and Security 4689
  before later same-process Sysmon dependent from 1 to 0. Automated eval passed
  at 96.89339473777208 over 78405 records. Blind scores were 66/64/48/76,
  average 63.5. The targeted lifecycle contradiction was fixed, but reviewers
  surfaced deeper remaining source-native issues: Windows remote-admin commands
  directly parented by `services.exe`, Linux SSH/session foreground child
  lifecycle ordering, eCAR remote-session `src_port` asymmetry, and endpoint
  FLOW exact-millisecond pair timing. Scenario-authoredness remains deferred per
  user request.

- Loop 247 fixed Windows remote-admin process parentage by adding a concrete
  short-lived SYSTEM `cmd.exe /c ...` owner for later service-context admin
  utilities while preserving live `PSEXESVC.exe` ownership for immediate
  PsExec follow-on commands and preserving the guard that old PsExec services do
  not own unrelated later commands. Focused parentage tests, broader
  remote-admin/service tests, config validation, Ruff checks, scenario
  validation, generation, automated eval, hard probes, and the full
  `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed with 3941 passed and 18 skipped. The
  hard probe moved DC-01 Security 4688 direct-`services.exe` parentage for
  `net.exe`, `sc.exe`, `schtasks.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` from 6/6 in loop 246
  to 0/6 in loop 247, with all six now parented by concrete shell owners.
  Automated eval passed at 96.84452779117338 over 78635 records. Blind scores
  were 42/36/36/34, average 37.0, all Inconclusive; no deliberation triggered.
  Remaining highest-leverage targets are now mostly Linux bash/syslog texture,
  eCAR SSH `USER_SESSION LOGIN` `src_port` symmetry, Zeek NTP service/log
  fan-out, and scenario/storyline polish. The 10-loop batch is complete, and
  scenario updates are still deferred until explicitly authorized.

- Loops 248-257 continued the current-dev blind realism loop on
  `scenarios/iteration-test`. The batch fixed eCAR SSH login/logout source-port
  symmetry, public DNS PTR/MX/NS/SOA realism, SSH receiver-side lifecycle,
  forward-proxy daemon identity, DNS answer/packet accounting, Windows Security
  5156 inbound directionality, firewall deny path ownership, paired endpoint
  eCAR FLOW millisecond texture, and Windows Security unavailable endpoint port
  rendering. Loop 256 moved exact same-ms cross-host eCAR FLOW pairs from 1804 to
  125 and scored 38/38/34/36, average 36.5. Loop 257 moved Windows
  address-dash/port-zero pairs from 322 to 0 and scored 32/63/34/46, average
  43.75; Detection's high score came from public DNS answer ownership rather
  than recurrence of the fixed Windows port issue. Highest-leverage remaining
  targets are recognizable public DNS answer ownership, generic Linux eCAR
  `/tmp/.cache-*` daemon file side effects, bash-history command-pool diversity,
  and source-side SCP flow attribution.

- Loops 258-267 continued the current-dev bounded assessment loop on
  `scenarios/iteration-test` without subagents. The batch fixed public DNS
  NS/MX/SOA answer ownership, Linux daemon eCAR file side-effect pools,
  source-side SSH/SCP command texture and file attribution, public AAAA profile
  ownership, upload source-prep/file-read evidence, Linux operator shell
  friction, NTP service/analyzer fan-out with public NTP pool selection, Nikto
  web-scan method diversity, and external port-scan event-presence matching for
  reset/allowed probe evidence. Loop 267 passed at 97.11049764410731 over
  81803 records with Event Presence at 35/35 and Storyline Trace Coverage at
  49/49. Focused tests, config validation, scenario validation, deterministic
  generation, eval, Ruff checks, and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite
  passed with 3983 passed and 18 skipped. The next highest-leverage assessment
  target is now remaining indicator accuracy and pivot linkability: inspect the
  59 indicator misses and 10 non-pivotable consecutive storyline pairs before
  deciding whether to fix canonical evidence or scenario-authoredness.
  A follow-up standalone blind panel was then run against a data-only copy of
  the current loop-267 output. Reviewer synthetic-confidence scores were Threat
  Hunter 42, Detection Engineer 28, Network Forensics 31, and Host/EDR
  Forensics 34, for an average of 33.75. Three reviewers assessed the data as
  Real and one as Inconclusive. Residual reviewer-backed targets are stable
  byte lengths for repeated hashed/static web assets, explicit/observable
  collection texture for small ASA-to-Zeek visibility misses, and tighter Linux
  eCAR SSH/SCP receiver process lifecycle pairing.

- Loop 268 fixed stable static web asset body-size texture by making full-200
  static resource sizes independent of client/User-Agent, virtual host, and
  cache-busting query strings. Focused tests, Ruff checks, and the full
  `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4178 passed, 18 skipped`), generation
  and eval succeeded at 96.83561790479325 over 90396 records, and the hard probe
  found 91 stable asset paths with zero variable-size full-200 paths. The
  standalone blind panel scored 49/68/66/74, average 64.25; deliberation
  triggered on verdict disagreement and converged to Synthetic with final
  average 69.0. The fixed static-asset family stayed clean, but reviewers
  surfaced a stronger next target: source timing/observation texture for paired
  endpoint eCAR FLOW rows, plus neighboring Sysmon-before-4688 and Linux
  server-role desktop/journald texture.

- Loop 269 partially improved paired endpoint eCAR FLOW timing texture by adding
  host-local timing offsets for unbounded paired FLOWs and separate handling for
  very short bounded intervals. Focused eCAR/source-timing tests, Ruff checks,
  and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4179 passed, 18
  skipped`). Automated eval stayed high at 96.88559994042029 over 90394 records.
  The hard probe moved exact same-ms cross-host FLOW tuple groups from 95 to 84
  and <=5ms groups from 1011 to 851, leaving residual Kerberos/short-service
  timing pairs. Blind initial scores were 46/38/68/58, average 52.5;
  deliberation triggered and settled at 50/44/63/60, final average 54.25
  (mixed/inconclusive). Reviewers no longer anchored on exact same-ms eCAR
  mirroring, but now cluster around flattened/too-clean eCAR FLOW semantics,
  missing eCAR logout/session correlation properties, pristine Zeek/network
  collection texture, incomplete normalized eCAR parent graph, placeholder
  Sysmon metadata, repeated `apt-get update` commands, and missing network
  evidence for a metadata-service curl.

- Loop 270 fixed eCAR `USER_SESSION/LOGOUT` correlation properties by declaring
  `logon_id`, `session_id`, and `logon_guid` eCAR fields, rendering durable
  session identifiers on login/logout rows, and propagating Linux SSH logind
  session IDs through SSH bundle eCAR events. Focused eCAR/session, SSH bundle,
  logoff, and object-graph tests passed; config validation, Ruff checks, fresh
  generation, eval, and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4182
  passed, 18 skipped`). Automated eval stayed at 96.88559994042029 over 90394
  records. The hard probe found 618 eCAR logout rows with 0 empty property maps,
  0 missing logon/session IDs, and 0 missing logon/session types. Blind initial
  scores were 68/46/28/46, average 47.0; deliberation settled at 70/52/32/54,
  average 51.5 (mixed/inconclusive). The strongest next target is now repeated
  host command/package-manager texture: 74 exact `apt-get update` creates,
  `yum` commands on apt/Ubuntu-like hosts, repeated bash-history command pools,
  plus related eCAR FLOW principal attribution gaps and hard-edged collection
  boundaries.

- Loop 271 fixed Linux package-manager activity alignment across bash command
  selection, proxy User-Agent selection, and endpoint process ownership by
  adding data-driven distro-family package-manager metadata, filtering
  incompatible bash/package commands by host OS, normalizing explicit-proxy
  package-manager User-Agents to the source distro family, and rendering apt
  proxy traffic through `/usr/lib/apt/methods/http(s)` helpers instead of
  repeated direct `apt-get update` process creates. Config validation,
  scenario validation, focused package/proxy/bash tests, Ruff checks, and the
  full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4190 passed, 18 skipped`).
  Automated eval passed at 96.97008227799 over 85916 records. The hard probe
  moved exact `apt-get update` eCAR process creates from 74 in loop 270 to 0,
  direct package-manager process creates to 0, known-source package User-Agent
  rows to 168, and distro/package-family mismatches to 0. Blind initial scores
  were 32/34/27/46, average 34.75 (mostly realistic); deliberation settled at
  36/36/29/43, final average 36.0. The old apt/yum/package-manager finding did
  not recur. The strongest next target is the broader Linux shell/session
  execution contract: timestamped bash-history commands such as `git status`,
  `docker logs`, `google-chrome`, `vmstat`, and `nginx -t` can still lack
  nearby eCAR PROCESS CREATE evidence, while comparable commands sometimes
  have it. Lower-impact follow-ups include Linux DBus/polkit management-service
  repetition, Zeek core/DMZ collection-profile texture, DB SCP file-size/byte
  consistency, and SMB filename vocabulary.

- Loop 272 fixed the broader Linux shell/session execution contract by mapping
  common bash-pool commands such as `vmstat`, `nginx`, `google-chrome`,
  `sha256sum | cut`, and `code` to source-native Linux executables, removing
  the random history-only drop for resolvable external shell commands, and
  bootstrapping assigned-user Linux workstation sessions before emitting
  workstation bash process telemetry. Focused shell/activity/eCAR tests, Ruff
  checks, and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4193 passed,
  18 skipped`). Automated eval passed at 96.97973723618829 over 84975 records,
  with Parseability 100.0, Plausibility 97.127289821273, Causality
  95.09527754763877, and Timing 94.62047696980169. The hard probe moved
  bash-history-to-eCAR PROCESS CREATE matching from 99/126 in the loop-271
  reference to 181/185 in loop 272, leaving 4 missing expected process
  instances. Blind initial scores were 67/63/39/38, average 52.0; deliberation
  settled at 67/64/39/40, final average 52.5 (split, modest synthetic lean).
  The old shell/process gap improved substantially. The strongest next target
  is SSH/proxy source-native texture: stop repeated `/run/sshd.pid` writes for
  ordinary SSH sessions, preserve realistic MIME/cache semantics for proxy
  304 static-asset rows, and tighten eCAR SSH FLOW-before-accepted/session
  ordering or explicitly model source-local collection delay.

- Loop 273 fixed repeated sshd pid-file churn by removing `/run/sshd.pid` from
  routine Linux sshd listener file side-effect pools so ordinary SSH activity
  renders as auth-log texture rather than repeated pid-file writes. Focused EDR
  pool tests, broader system-process/eCAR/emitter tests, config validation,
  scenario validation, Ruff checks, and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite
  passed (`4194 passed, 18 skipped`). Automated eval held at
  96.97973723618829 over 84975 records, with Parseability 100.0,
  Plausibility 97.127289821273, Causality 95.09527754763877, and Timing
  94.62047696980169. The hard probe found 0 `/run/sshd.pid` samples in sshd
  churn output and 13 sshd auth-log style rows. Blind initial scores were
  58/36/57/62, average 53.75; deliberation settled at 56/54/59/56, final
  average 56.25, with all reviewers inconclusive leaning synthetic. The next
  target is proxy/CDN/browser and collection-imperfection texture, starting
  with proxy 304 static-asset rows that still appeared as `text/html MISS`
  instead of object-type cache revalidations.

- Loop 274 fixed proxy 304 cache revalidation semantics by rendering cacheable
  304 rows as object-type `REVALIDATED` responses while keeping Zeek 304 HTTP
  rows free of response MIME metadata because no response body is observable.
  Focused proxy/HTTP tests, config validation, scenario validation, Ruff checks,
  generation, eval, and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4196
  passed, 18 skipped`). Automated eval held at 96.97973723618829 over 84975
  records, with Parseability 100.0, Plausibility 97.127289821273, Causality
  95.09527754763877, and Timing 94.62047696980169. The hard probe found 36/36
  static-asset 304 proxy rows rendered `REVALIDATED`, 0 `text/html MISS` rows,
  and 0 Zeek 304 rows with nonempty response MIME metadata. Blind initial scores
  were 62/62/38/58, average 55.0; deliberation settled at 64/64/44/60, final
  average 58.0. The fixed proxy 304 family improved enough that the consensus
  next target is Linux SSH/eCAR session identity and lifecycle ownership: unify
  syslog and eCAR session IDs, source tuples, sshd/shell process chains,
  login/logout boundaries, and flow principal behavior for modeled SSH sessions.

- Loop 275 fixed Linux SSH/eCAR session identity by preserving already-monotonic
  canonical systemd-logind IDs during syslog finalization and by making the
  `StateManager` Linux logind allocator timestamp-ordered down to coarse
  same-minute seconds. Focused StateManager/syslog/SSH/eCAR tests, Ruff checks,
  generation, eval, and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4200
  passed, 18 skipped`). Automated eval held at 96.97973723618829 over 84975
  records, with Parseability 100.0, Plausibility 97.127289821273, Causality
  95.09527754763877, and Timing 94.62047696980169. The hard probe found 91
  visible syslog SSH sessions, 87 eCAR SSH login sessions, 87 matched tuple
  sessions, 0 session-ID mismatches, 4 syslog-only sessions, and 0 eCAR-only
  sessions. Blind initial scores were 31/28/38/44, average 35.25; deliberation
  settled at 32/30/38/42, final average 35.0. No reviewer called the data
  Synthetic, and the loop-274 SSH identity finding did not recur. The next
  target is shell pipeline/eCAR process completeness: emit complete eCAR child
  process evidence for both sides of bash-history pipelines, or make missing
  sides explainable through source-native failure or collection behavior.
  Queued behind that are Zeek capture imperfections, TLS/proxy variance, and
  host-specific Windows endpoint source-mix variation.

- Loop 276 fixed shell pipeline/eCAR process completeness by adding
  `pt-query-digest` mapping/foreground classification and preserving pipeline
  stage order during Linux shell foreground eCAR timing normalization. Focused
  shell/activity/source-timing tests, Ruff checks, generation, eval, and the
  full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4201 passed, 18 skipped`).
  Automated eval passed at 96.97978666252297 over 84978 records, with
  Parseability 100.0, Plausibility 97.12748752661176, Causality
  95.09527754763877, and Timing 94.62047696980169. The hard probe found 31
  bash-history pipeline commands with 56 expected mapped process stages, 56
  matched eCAR PROCESS CREATE rows, 0 missing stages, and 0 stage-order
  inversions, including the previously cited `pt-query-digest ... | head -50`
  and `find ... | head` cases. Blind initial scores were 44/28/31/34, average
  34.25; deliberation settled at 42/30/32/35, final average 34.25. Three
  reviewers called the data Real and one called it Inconclusive leaning Real.
  The pipeline finding did not recur. The next target is Linux eCAR auth-log
  file ownership: avoid rendering `/var/log/auth.log` writes as direct `sshd`
  listener writes; prefer syslog/journald/rsyslog ownership or source-profile
  suppression, and add a rendered-output probe for auth-log FILE WRITE actor
  ownership.

- Loop 277 fixed Linux eCAR auth-log file ownership by moving routine sshd
  listener side effects from `/var/log/auth.log` WRITE rows to
  `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` READ rows, while allowing `read` as a validated EDR
  side-effect action. Focused EDR/spillage tests, config validation, scenario
  validation, Ruff checks, generation, eval, and the full
  `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4201 passed, 18 skipped`). Automated
  eval passed at 96.9797858555115 over 84978 records, with Parseability 100.0,
  Plausibility 97.12748429856588, Causality 95.09527754763877, and Timing
  94.62047696980169. The hard probe found 4 `/var/log/auth.log` eCAR FILE rows,
  0 sshd-owned auth-log rows, 4 syslog-family auth-log rows, and 13 sshd config
  READ rows; the generated Linux syslog corpus also contained 7 `syslog.log`
  files and 373 sshd rows. Blind initial scores were 36/42/36/61, average
  43.75; deliberation settled at 38/43/37/52, final average 42.5 after
  fact-checking one reviewer's mistaken claim that Linux syslog/auth logs were
  absent. The 10-loop batch requested by the user is complete. If another loop
  is run, prioritize collection imperfection and Linux bash texture: selective
  endpoint drops, delayed ingestion, missing proxy enrichment, sparse Zeek
  child-log gaps, fewer one-command SSH history stubs, denser primary-user bash
  histories, and the isolated Zeek files/protocol timestamp edge case.

- Loop 278 started a new requested 10-loop assessment batch and tested
  collection-imperfection texture by adding source-observation
  `format_missingness` plus Zeek files/conn interval guards. Focused tests,
  config validation, scenario validation, Ruff checks, generation, eval, and the
  full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4446 passed, 19 skipped`).
  Automated eval passed at 97.2183584632452 over 89427 records, with
  Parseability 100.0, Plausibility 95.92217578332037, Causality
  94.69898357220872, and Timing 97.81534312181459. The hard probe found 13198
  Zeek conn UIDs and 0 `files.json` rows outside the parent conn interval. Blind initial
  scores were 31/62/36/52, average 45.25; deliberation settled at 39/64/40/54,
  final average 49.25. Reviewers judged the sparse Zeek child gaps realistic in
  spirit but too independent: visible SSL/DNS/HTTP/files/x509 references can
  survive after same-sensor sibling rows or conn parents are dropped. The next
  target is coherent Zeek sibling suppression, then Linux server desktop/Polkit
  gating and eCAR FLOW attribution.

- Loop 279 fixed the loop-278 Zeek orphan-reference finding by batching
  observation decisions per event, promoting required same-sensor parent rows,
  and pruning HTTP/SSL reference vectors when dependent files/x509 rows are
  absent. Focused dispatcher/Zeek tests, config validation, scenario validation,
  Ruff checks, generation, eval, and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite
  passed (`4450 passed, 19 skipped`). Automated eval passed at
  97.46871613111875 over 89448 records, with Parseability 100.0, Plausibility
  96.9220144746488, Causality 94.70057555237452, and Timing
  97.81534312181459. The hard probe found 0 Zeek protocol UID or FUID orphan
  groups across core and DMZ sensors. Blind initial scores were 34/54/39/56,
  average 45.75; deliberation was not triggered because all reviewers returned
  Inconclusive and the score spread was below threshold. Both detection and
  network reviewers explicitly called Zeek UID/FUID integrity strong. The next
  target is proxy/web application texture: reduce generic inspected root `GET`
  rows for CDN/API hosts, replace zero-heavy synthetic asset hashes with
  vendor-specific path shapes, and keep Zeek integrity as a regression anchor.

- Loop 280 fixed proxy/web texture by generating stable cache-buster `{hex16}`
  tokens from full SHA-256 digest entropy instead of zero-padded 32-bit seeds
  and by keeping root/index HTML response sizes host-specific while preserving
  shared byte stability for true static assets. Focused HTTP/site-map tests,
  config validation, scenario validation, Ruff checks, generation, eval, and the
  full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4452 passed, 19 skipped`).
  Automated eval passed at 96.88503046001232 over 83733 records, with
  Parseability 100.0, Plausibility 97.22367794053588, Causality
  93.03634850166482, and Timing 96.60011924731073. The hard probe found
  zero-padded hex64 proxy URI rows reduced from 131 to 0, root HTML top-size
  ratio reduced by 0.0095, and root HTML unique-size ratio improved by 0.2406.
  Blind initial scores were 52/52/36/74, average 53.5; deliberation settled at
  56/57/41/72, final average 56.5. Network reviewers validated the proxy/Zeek
  texture improvement, while Host/EDR and Threat Hunter converged on a broader
  next target: role-aware endpoint and server/DC behavior, including eCAR
  identity propagation, Linux syslog role profiles, and suppressing
  workstation-like browsing/scripting from infrastructure hosts.

- Loop 281 fixed eCAR actor-linked user FLOW identity by preserving `principal`
  whenever an outbound FLOW is safely linked to a known user-owned actor process,
  while retaining service/root principal gaps. Focused eCAR tests, config
  validation, scenario validation, Ruff checks, generation, eval, and the full
  `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4453 passed, 19 skipped`). Automated
  eval held at 96.88503046001232 over 83733 records, with Parseability 100.0,
  Plausibility 97.22367794053588, Causality 93.03634850166482, and Timing
  96.60011924731073. The hard probe found actor-linked user outbound FLOW rows
  with missing/mismatched principals reduced from 64 to 0 across 815 loop-281
  candidate rows. Blind initial scores were 36/38/42/78, average 48.5;
  deliberation settled at 40/45/46/76, final average 51.75. Detection and threat
  hunting scores improved substantially, while Host/EDR surfaced sharper
  source-native tells: Linux `polkitd` `unix-process:PID:<value>` values use
  UID-like buckets (`0`, `1000`, `2000`), Windows 4800/4801 lock/unlock fields
  have non-native `TargetUser*`/`TargetLogonId` shape, and server listener FLOW
  attribution remains uneven. The next target is Host/EDR source-native
  rendering and background texture, starting with polkit PID/starttime realism
  and Windows 4800/4801 native field semantics.

- Loop 282 fixed the strongest loop-281 Host/EDR source-native tell by rendering
  realistic Linux polkit `unix-process:PID:STARTTIME` start ticks from host boot
  time and transient PID identity instead of using YAML placeholder values
  (`0`, `1000`, `2000`). Focused polkit tests, config validation, scenario
  validation, Ruff checks, generation, eval, and the full
  `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4453 passed, 19 skipped`). Automated
  eval passed at 97.34383523719569 over 89408 records, with Parseability 100.0,
  Plausibility 97.18509319457112, Causality 94.62633938333698, and Timing
  96.9548854635933. The hard probe found canned polkit process-start values
  reduced from 238/238 rows to 0/288 rows, and unique start-tick values increased
  from 3 to 288. Blind initial scores were 28/34/32/34, average 32.0; deliberation
  was skipped because all reviewers judged the dataset Real and the score spread
  was only 6. Host/EDR no longer repeated the polkit finding, and Detection did
  not repeat the Windows 4800/4801 field-shape concern. The next target is
  source-specific collection texture: endpoint/eCAR normalization asymmetry,
  Zeek file-analysis imperfections, DHCP/NTP texture, and TLS edge cases.

- Loop 283 added Zeek file-analysis collection texture by introducing low-rate
  missing-byte/timeout imperfections for HTTP and SMB file-analysis rows and
  suppressing analyzers/hashes when capture is incomplete. Focused Zeek files
  tests, config validation, scenario validation, Ruff checks, generation, eval,
  and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4455 passed, 19 skipped`).
  Automated eval passed at 96.26962688034575 over 85795 records, with
  Parseability 100.0, Plausibility 97.03030721919626, Causality
  91.54145089770225, and Timing 95.6334367556056. The hard probe increased
  imperfect non-SSL Zeek file rows from 1/231 to 10/223 while keeping hash
  contradictions at 0. Blind initial scores were 43/34/34/30, average 35.25;
  deliberation was skipped because the spread was only 13 and reviewers found no
  hard source-native contradiction. The next target is Zeek NTP source-native
  texture: normalize poll/precision representation and add host/server/poll
  diversity without breaking conn/ntp UID correlation.

- Loop 284 fixed Zeek NTP source-native representation by rendering precision as
  a small interval in seconds and diversifying association poll values across
  client/server pairs while preserving UID correlation. Focused NTP tests,
  config validation, scenario validation, Ruff checks, generation, eval, and the
  full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4456 passed, 19 skipped`).
  Automated eval held at 96.26962688034575 over 85795 records, with Parseability
  100.0, Plausibility 97.03030721919626, Causality 91.54145089770225, and
  Timing 95.6334367556056. The hard probe changed NTP poll values from only
  `[4096.0]` to `[1024.0, 2048.0, 4096.0]`, reduced negative precision rows
  from 8 to 0, and preserved 0 orphan/non-response NTP UID rows. Blind initial
  scores were 46/58/32/58, average 48.5; deliberation was skipped because the
  spread was 26 and all reviewers stayed inconclusive. Network no longer flagged
  the precision representation, but found a remaining cadence contradiction
  where a `poll=2048.0` association repeated after about 241 seconds. Host/EDR
  found a high-confidence shell-rendering tell (`make clean && make all`
  attached to `/usr/bin/make`), and Detection flagged Squid inbound/outbound
  FLOW principal asymmetry. Next targets: NTP cadence semantics, then Linux shell
  compound command rendering and proxy process principal consistency.

- Loop 285 tightened Zeek NTP cadence semantics by adding a canonical parser
  cadence guard for same client/server NTP associations. Too-soon response-bearing
  UDP/123 connections remain visible as `conn.log` evidence, but no longer fan out
  to `ntp.log` before a plausible association interval has elapsed. Focused NTP
  tests, config validation, scenario validation, Ruff checks, generation, eval,
  and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4457 passed, 19 skipped`).
  Automated eval passed at 96.65290772815344 over 85286 records. The hard probe
  found 10 NTP rows, 0 cadence violations, 0 orphan UIDs, 0 non-response NTP rows,
  0 negative precision rows, and poll values `[1024.0, 2048.0, 4096.0]`. Blind
  initial scores were 38/32/34/30, average 33.5; deliberation was skipped. Network
  and Threat Hunter reviewers still saw the suppressed NTP parser row as a possible
  conn/detail contract gap because the corresponding `conn.log` row retained
  `service="ntp"`. Next targets: Linux shell compound command rendering and then
  proxy process principal consistency / NTP detail-label semantics.

- Loop 286 fixed Linux catalog compound-command rendering by splitting shell
  compound commands into source-native child process rows while preserving the
  full typed command in bash history. Focused shell/catalog tests, config
  validation, scenario validation, Ruff checks, generation, eval, and the full
  `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4459 passed, 19 skipped`). Automated
  eval passed at 96.27765021125614 over 83339 records. The hard probe found
  0 Linux non-shell compound process rows; `/usr/bin/make` rows now use
  `make clean` and `make all` command lines, while bash history still includes
  full compound shell text. Blind initial scores were 34/18/28/52, average 33.0;
  deliberation was skipped. Host/EDR no longer repeated the Linux `make clean &&
  make all` source-native process tell, while Network flagged repeated NTP
  `root_delay`/`root_disp` values and Host/EDR flagged eCAR module-load /
  one-shot process lifetime semantics. Next targets: NTP per-poll metric texture
  and eCAR lifecycle semantics.

- Loop 287 fixed NTP per-poll metric texture and parser-label semantics. Stable
  server/association traits remain stable, while `root_delay` and `root_disp`
  now vary deterministically per observed poll; too-soon UDP/123 responses remain
  visible in `conn.json` but no longer retain `service=ntp` when the NTP parser
  row is intentionally suppressed. Focused NTP tests, config validation,
  scenario validation, Ruff checks, generation, eval, and the full
  `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4459 passed, 19 skipped`). Automated
  eval passed at 96.27765021125614 over 83339 records. The hard probe reduced
  exact repeated NTP metric excess from 3 to 0 and `conn.service=ntp` rows missing
  NTP detail from 1 to 0, while cadence, orphan, non-response, and negative
  precision checks stayed at 0. Blind initial scores were 34/41/38/42, average
  38.75; deliberation was skipped because the spread was only 8. Reviewers did
  not repeat the NTP metric finding. Next targets: proxy/web search-referrer and
  cache semantics, Linux session parentage (`systemd -> -bash`), eCAR FLOW actor
  attribution near known processes, and multi-sensor Zeek mirroring texture.

- Loop 288 fixed proxy/web search-referrer and cache semantics at the proxy URI
  planning, browsing-session eligibility, and site-metadata layers. Search
  referrers are now limited to human-visible landing/content pages, API/auth/CDN
  paths suppress inherited referrers, CDN-shaped hosts use asset templates, and
  proxy `304` rows render as revalidations without being gated by cacheable MIME
  checks. Focused tests passed (`131 passed`), config validation and scenario
  validation passed, Ruff checks passed, and generation/eval completed after the
  final hostname hardening. The full suite also passed during the loop before the
  last `api-` hardening patch (`4498 passed, 19 skipped`). Automated eval passed
  at 97.35856812863797 over 84790 records. The hard probe found API search
  referrers at 0, CDN root HTML success rows at 0, and bad 304 cache rows at 0.
  Blind initial scores were 38/54/42/67, average 50.25; deliberation triggered
  on verdict disagreement and averaged 53.5. The next target is RDP/service-role
  contracts: source-host RDP client/process companions for successful RDP flows
  and suppression or service-backed modeling of RDP/SMB-like traffic to
  Linux-looking receivers.

- Loop 289 fixed RDP/SMB service-role contracts across baseline, profile,
  process-network, scanner-overlap, and eCAR failed-flow rendering paths.
  Successful guarded-port traffic now requires a compatible receiver role,
  service alias, or OS capability; unsupported probes remain visible as failed
  attempts. Focused RDP/scanner/activity/eCAR tests, config validation, scenario
  validation, Ruff checks, generation, eval, and the full `uv run pytest
  --no-cov` suite passed (`4507 passed, 19 skipped`). Automated eval passed at
  97.41034946914596 over 84607 records, with Parseability 100.0, Plausibility
  97.155877218378, Causality 94.64830022918258, and Timing 97.29652553627908.
  The hard probe found 0 successful RDP-to-Linux-without-xrdp and 0 successful
  SMB-to-Linux-without-Samba violations in both Zeek and eCAR. Blind initial
  scores were 42/42/48/65, average 49.25; deliberation was skipped because all
  reviewers stayed mixed/inconclusive and the spread was 23. The next target is
  Linux eCAR session identity/lifecycle ownership, especially same-host session
  ID reuse across users, followed by SSH process-label source-native rendering.

- Loop 290 fixed Linux eCAR local session identity and SSH process-label
  source-native rendering. Linux `systemd-logind` session IDs are now persisted
  back onto canonical `ActiveSession` state before eCAR USER_SESSION rendering,
  overlapping local Linux sessions keep distinct source-native IDs, and SSH
  listener/responder process labels no longer leak `[listener]` or `[accepted]`
  placeholders. Focused Linux-session, SSH/Zeek responder, and EDR-pool tests
  passed; config validation, scenario validation, Ruff checks, generation, eval,
  and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4508 passed, 19
  skipped`). Automated eval passed at 97.41034946914596 over 84607 records.
  The hard probe found 0 same-host Linux session-ID multi-user groups, 0
  multi-logon groups, 0 login/logout mismatches for non-empty LogonIDs, and 0
  SSH placeholder labels. Blind initial scores were 52/52/68/66, average 59.5;
  deliberation triggered on verdict disagreement and averaged 61.5. The next
  target is endpoint texture: repeated static uninstall registry writes,
  DC/server workstation-style user activity, and one-sided Sysmon-before-Security
  process timing bias.

- Loop 291 fixed repeated ambient static software-inventory registry churn by
  adding a data-driven `registry_noise.static_inventory_values` policy and
  suppressing uninstall/installer inventory fields from ambient registry noise
  at the baseline selection layer. Explicit installer/update templates remain
  available in the EDR pools. Focused registry/config tests passed (`9 passed`);
  config validation, Ruff checks, generation, eval, and the full
  `uv run pytest --no-cov` suite passed (`4510 passed, 19 skipped`). Automated
  eval passed at 96.91951923183318 over 84763 records, with Parseability 100.0,
  Plausibility 97.12001102692554, Causality 93.83522324592488, and Timing
  95.90355331810284. The hard probe reduced eCAR static inventory registry
  writes from 1014 to 0 and found 0 matching Sysmon text occurrences. Blind
  initial scores were 38/22/34/64, average 39.5; deliberation triggered on
  verdict disagreement and averaged 46.25 with final scores 46/38/39/62. The
  next target, if resumed, is Windows endpoint texture: eCAR Prefetch actor/source
  semantics and Windows 4624 subject-field variation, followed by Zeek DMZ
  TLS/files/x509 grouped certificate contract repair.

- Loop 292 target contracts started on branch `codex/host-edr-root-cause-fixes`.
  The selected Host/EDR families are: (1) Prefetch FILE ownership, owned by the
  EDR pool config/loader and process-aware side-effect selector; invariant:
  ambient churn must not attach arbitrary actors to Prefetch artifacts, and
  process-side Prefetch paths must derive from the owning executable name.
  (2) Windows 4624 subject identity, owned by canonical `AuthContext` assignment
  in the successful-logon bundle; invariant: service/machine/system logons keep
  source-native SYSTEM/0x3e7 or anonymous subjects, while user-driven remote and
  unlock/reauth paths can inherit a real session/caller subject when state has
  one. (3) Server/DC workstation-style web-tool bleed, owned by explicit proxy
  client hints and world-planner connection-process selection; invariant:
  server/DC proxy or admin traffic should use service/package/admin-tool owners
  or omit PID attribution, not spawn generic workstation web tools such as
  `curl.exe`, `wget.exe`, or `python.exe` unless explicit scenario/storyline
  intent created them.
- Loop 292 fixed those three Host/EDR families at their owning layers. Prefetch
  paths moved out of generic ambient churn and into process-aware side-effect
  profiles; Windows successful-logon subject fields now use modeled caller/source
  session state for user-driven Type 3/10/7 paths while preserving SYSTEM,
  machine, service, and anonymous subjects; server/DC web/proxy ownership now
  uses server/admin/service UAs, server-admin persona overlays, restricted
  internal web-access source pools, and explicit-proxy PID repair that either
  owns a matching process or omits stale shell/daemon/tool attribution. Focused
  tests passed (`66 passed`), full Ruff checks passed, `uv run eforge
  validate-config` passed with 0 issues, scenario validation remained valid with
  the existing 16 warnings, and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov -q` suite passed
  (`4519 passed, 19 skipped`). Automated eval passed at 97.49445666259291 over
  78191 records. The loop-292 hard probe artifact
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-292/post_probe_host_edr_root_causes.json`
  found 0 Prefetch bad actions, 0 Prefetch process-name mismatches, 0 server-like
  workstation-tool eCAR PROCESS hits, and 0 server-like workstation-tool eCAR FLOW
  hits; Windows 4624 Type 10 and Type 7 subjects now show real user/session
  subjects for user-driven paths, with Type 5 service logons still SYSTEM.
  Residual note: broad registry/software-inventory texture still includes browser
  App Paths on server/DC hosts, but no longer as PROCESS/FLOW ownership in the
  selected Host/EDR family.

- Loop 293 generated a fresh dataset from the same iteration-test scenario and
  ran the Host reviewer only. Automated eval passed at 97.49445666259291 over
  78191 records. Host/EDR scored the data as Real with verdict confidence 64
  and synthetic-confidence 34. A follow-up hard probe found browser App Paths
  registry inventory texture still present on server/DC hosts (`DC-01`: 12,
  `FILE-SRV-01`: 10), but not as PROCESS/FLOW ownership.

- Loop 294 fixed the browser App Paths root cause by classifying
  `CurrentVersion\App Paths` `Path` values as static installed-software
  inventory in the endpoint noise policy, so the baseline ambient registry
  generator suppresses them before event construction. Focused regression,
  config validation, Ruff checks, and the full `uv run pytest --no-cov -q`
  suite passed (`4519 passed, 19 skipped`). A regenerated dataset passed
  automated eval at 97.03288664965147 over 81786 records. The hard probe found
  0 browser App Paths registry rows on server-like hosts. The Host-only rerun
  scored Inconclusive with verdict confidence 64 and synthetic-confidence 54;
  findings shifted to Linux sysstat cron timing, syslog/eCAR cron PID/TID
  agreement, perfect chronological ordering texture, and eCAR collection-window
  shape. The browser App Paths issue was not repeated in the Host findings.

## Recent Completed Work Previously Kept in TODO

- Codex fix-family PR disposition and rework completed: rejected PRs were closed
  with rationale, acceptable PRs were merged, and accept-with-changes PRs were
  reworked.
- Full slow-suite regression cleanup completed after the recent fix-family work.
  The successful recorded run was `uv run pytest --no-cov --include-slow` with
  `3771 passed, 2 skipped`.
- Earlier assessment work completed many source-native realism fixes across
  Kerberos/DC evidence, X.509/DNS/TLS, eCAR/session/FLOW ownership, Linux
  syslog/bash texture, proxy/browser semantics, Zeek HTTP reuse, and Windows
  process/session timing.

- Loop 295 fixed the Linux cron/sysstat source-identity family. Cron schedules
  now ignore legacy slot jitter while keeping per-host minute offsets; cron
  shell/workload process create and terminate events share a canonical
  concurrency group; eCAR observation preserves cron groups that correlate with
  visible CRON syslog; Linux eCAR PID morphology preserves canonical PIDs for
  those cron-correlated rows; and PROCESS/CREATE TID normalization keeps
  `tid == pid`. Focused regression tests passed, generation completed, and the
  automated eval passed at 97.03278661249382 over 79007 records. The hard probe
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-295/hard_probe_linux_cron_ecar_identity.json`
  found 0 cron nonzero-second rows, 0 syslog/eCAR shell PID mismatches, and 0
  Linux PROCESS/CREATE TID mismatches across 65 cron sysstat rows. The full
  blind panel plus deliberation is saved under
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-295/`; initial synthetic-confidence
  scores were Threat Hunter 32, Detection Engineer 34, Network Forensics 68,
  and Host/EDR 56. Deliberation prioritized proxy-origin DNS causality as the
  next P0: multiple proxy-origin TLS handshakes precede first visible proxy DNS
  for the same SNI/IP despite short later TTLs, with overly tight CONNECT-to-TLS
  timing as the sibling texture issue.

- Loop 296 fixed proxy-origin DNS causality and CONNECT-to-origin timing texture.
  The proxy transaction bundle now emits uncached forced proxy-side DNS
  prerequisites before origin egress, and forward-proxy-origin external HTTP/TLS
  connections force visible DNS even when callers suppress client-side DNS.
  Automated eval passed at 96.69940951837162 over 95401 records. The hard probe
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-296/hard_probe_proxy_dns_causality.json`
  found 0 origin TLS rows without prior proxy DNS evidence across 1118 origin TLS
  rows, and CONNECT-to-origin TLS p50/p90 gaps of 5.25s/10.43s. Blind initial
  synthetic-confidence scores were Threat Hunter 43, Detection Engineer 48,
  Network Forensics 43, and Host/EDR 68; deliberation average was 51.0. The next
  target selected was Linux eCAR FLOW ownership and local shell parentage.

- Loop 297 fixed Linux eCAR FLOW shell ownership and local shell parentage. Generic
  Linux HTTP/HTTPS endpoint PID inference no longer chooses `/bin/bash`; world
  planner connection-owner selection filters shells; Linux local session shells
  now get user-session/terminal/login parents; and HTTP process-network mapping
  was added to data-driven config. Automated eval passed at 96.63103924384974
  over 102592 records. The hard probe
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-297/hard_probe_linux_ecar_flow_shell_parentage.json`
  showed bash-owned FLOW rows dropped from 50 to 1 explicit reverse-shell payload
  and local `-bash` direct PID1/systemd parentage dropped to 0. Blind initial
  synthetic-confidence scores were Threat Hunter 34, Detection Engineer 29,
  Network Forensics 67, and Host/EDR 64; deliberation average was 61.5. A
  follow-up probe
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-297/hard_probe_zeek_client_first_rstr_byte_direction.json`
  confirmed the next P0: 42 client-first TCP `RSTR`/`ShAdr` rows with
  `orig_bytes=0`, `resp_bytes>0`, and `missed_bytes=0` across SMB, LDAP, HTTP,
  TLS, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and TDS. The next loop should fix this at the canonical
  network/protocol layer before tackling SSH/RDP eCAR transport/auth timing.
  Final local verification passed with `uv run ruff check .`,
  `uv run ruff format --check .`, `uv run eforge validate-config`, and
  `uv run pytest --no-cov -q` (`4553 passed, 19 skipped`).

- Loops 298-307 continued the dev-branch assessment loop and archived all
  artifacts under `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-298/` through
  `loop-307/`. Loop 298 fixed client-first TCP byte/history ordering for Zeek
  reset rows; loop 299 fixed explicit proxy CONNECT origin companions; loop 300
  fixed DNS resolver/proxy cache texture; loop 301 fixed inbound
  transport-before-auth timing; loop 302 fixed MSI HTTP/file MIME and Zeek PE
  fanout; loop 303 fixed Zeek TLS/X.509 companion observation; loop 304 fixed
  Windows Security 5156 WFP direction/layer semantics; loop 305 fixed Windows
  4672-after-4624 same-LogonID ordering; loop 306 fixed successful SSH
  auth/session atomicity; loop 307 fixed eCAR ICMP FLOW properties by omitting
  fake transport ports and rendering `icmp_type`/`icmp_code`. Automated eval
  stayed in the 96.20-97.41 range and loop 307 ended at 97.08506388397319 over
  79015 records.

- Loop 307 final panel findings selected the next highest-impact families:
  repeated SSH failed-auth syslog ordering contradictions (`Failed password`
  before same-tuple `Connection from` plus username flips), repeated RDP
  Security 4624/4625 auth-before-eCAR-FLOW ordering, lower-volume Zeek DNS/HTTP
  /TLS companion gaps, and FILE-SRV `net view` duplicate `cmd.exe` wrapper
  texture. The loop-307 ICMP target verified clean: 238/238 ICMP eCAR FLOW rows
  omitted `src_port`/`dst_port` and included `icmp_type=8`/`icmp_code=0`.

- Loops 308-310 continued the dev-branch assessment loop. Loop 308 fixed Linux
  SSH failed-auth source-native ordering and username semantics; loop 309 fixed
  source SSH command username propagation into destination generic SSH preauth
  syslog; loop 310 fixed Windows locked-session foreground activity by recording
  lock intervals, deferring/skipping baseline activity while locked, emitting
  pending unlocks independently, and blocking host-level process ownership from
  locked workstation logons. Loop 310 automated eval passed at
  96.47478843254147 over 84585 records, and the locked-session hard probe found
  0 violations. The next P0 is source-local session lifecycle ordering:
  loop-310 blind review and
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-310/hard_probe_session_lifecycle_ordering.json`
  found one Windows Security 4634-before-4624 group and one eCAR USER_SESSION
  LOGOUT-before-LOGIN group for short network logons.

- Loop 311 fixed source-local session lifecycle ordering. Windows Security final
  rendering now treats matching 4624 rows as prerequisites for 4634 logoff
  repair, and eCAR final normalization moves USER_SESSION LOGOUT rows after
  matching successful LOGIN rows. Automated eval passed at 96.4753649476231 over
  84585 records, full local verification passed (`4704 passed, 19 skipped`),
  and hard probes found 0 session lifecycle, locked-session, SSH failed-auth, or
  SSH username violations. Blind review selected proxy-origin DNS causality as
  the next P0: `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-311/hard_probe_proxy_origin_dns_causality.json`
  found 18 proxy-origin TLS rows whose SNI/IP had no prior visible Zeek A answer.

- Loop 312 partially fixed proxy-origin DNS causality/cache state. Explicit proxy
  egress and direct forward-proxy external HTTP/TLS paths now force uncached
  proxy-side A lookups shortly before origin egress, and invisible/pre-window DNS
  cache observations no longer suppress the first visible forced lookup. Automated
  eval passed at 96.5498460793631 over 90768 records, repo-wide Ruff checks passed,
  and full local verification passed (`4707 passed, 19 skipped`). The hard probe
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-312/hard_probe_proxy_origin_dns_causality.json`
  improved from 18 broad no-prior rows to 9 across 1120 proxy-origin TLS rows.
  Blind review no longer prioritized proxy DNS: initial synthetic-confidence
  scores were Threat Hunter 62, Detection Engineer 32, Network Forensics 31, and
  Host/EDR 38; deliberation final scores were 52/36/33/40, average 40.25. The next
  highest-leverage target is eCAR FLOW principal attribution plus endpoint baseline
  texture, especially known PID/image FLOW rows with null principals while nearby
  source-local activity carries `SYSTEM`, `LOCAL SERVICE`, `NETWORK SERVICE`, or a
  user principal.

- Loop 313 fixed the eCAR FLOW principal attribution policy by raising the
  data-driven service/root/listener principal visibility probabilities so retained
  PID/image provenance no longer flips independently from known principal evidence.
  Automated eval passed at 96.31130005616335 over 90768 records, full local
  verification passed (`4708 passed, 19 skipped`), and
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-313/hard_probe_ecar_flow_principal_attribution.json`
  found 0 FLOW rows retaining PID/image while omitting principal when the same
  host/PID/image had principal-bearing activity (down from 2865 on pre-fix data).
  Blind scores were Threat Hunter 44, Detection Engineer 43, Network Forensics 18,
  and Host/EDR 62; deliberation final scores were 49/48/24/64, average 46.25. The
  next target is eCAR Group Policy registry semantics: replace one-off random
  `Extension-List` GUID keys with a stable realistic client-side extension GUID set
  reused by host/policy cycle, then follow with Windows Security 1102 EventData and
  eCAR SSH session identifier consistency.

- Loop 314 fixed eCAR Group Policy registry semantics at the shared data-pool and
  materializer layer. `edr_pools.yaml` now provides a bounded
  `group_policy_extension_guids` pool, the `Extension-List` HKLM template uses a
  dedicated `group_policy_extension_guid` placeholder, and the EDR pool loader
  validates GUID-shaped overlays. The shared materializer chooses from a stable
  per-host subset and reuses one value inside a template group, covering both
  baseline registry churn and process-side registry side effects. Automated eval
  passed at 95.74878158737843 over 95168 records, focused EDR pool tests passed
  (`58 passed`), config validation passed, and full local verification passed
  (`4711 passed, 19 skipped`). The hard probe
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-314/hard_probe_ecar_group_policy_registry_guid_reuse.json`
  checked 293 Group Policy `Extension-List` rows and found 0 invalid GUIDs, 0
  hosts with one unique GUID per row, and a maximum of 5 unique GUIDs per host from
  a configured pool of 6. Blind scores were Threat Hunter 46, Detection Engineer
  34, Network Forensics 38, and Host/EDR 39, average 39.25; deliberation was not
  triggered because all reviewers returned inconclusive and score spread was only
  12. The prior Group Policy issue did not recur; Host/EDR cited Group Policy
  registry texture positively. Next target candidates are Windows service-account
  4648 texture (`services.exe` explicit credential use repetition), workstation
  Security/Sysmon event-family ratio sameness, proxy CONNECT companion gaps,
  Linux bash command-pool repetition, and secondary source-profile polish.

- Loop 315 fixed Windows service-account 4648 caller texture. Benign service-account
  delegation is now data-driven under `auth_noise.yaml` with role-specific backup,
  monitoring, deployment, reporting, and default service-task caller profiles. Baseline
  service-account delegation now selects/reuses an agent process from that profile instead
  of emitting every 4648 as `C:\Windows\System32\services.exe`. Validation schemas and
  overlay checks were extended for the new config section. Automated eval passed at
  96.28554535209074 over 92587 records, focused auth-noise tests passed, config validation
  passed, and full local verification passed (`4714 passed, 19 skipped`). The hard probe
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-315/hard_probe_service_account_4648_callers.json`
  checked 28 service-account 4648 rows and found 0 `services.exe` callers across 6
  distinct caller images. Blind scores were Threat Hunter 37, Detection Engineer 34,
  Network Forensics 43, and Host/EDR 36, average 37.5; deliberation was not triggered.
  The service-account 4648 issue did not recur. Next target candidates are proxy HTTPS
  inspection semantics, DNS-to-TLS timing texture, eCAR actor object completeness for
  long-lived daemon actors, IDS alert texture, and secondary DHCP/bash/1102 polish.

- Loop 316 fixed proxy HTTPS inspection semantics. Default proxy access rows now render
  explicit inspection metadata (`proxy_action=ssl-inspect ssl_bump=bump`) on inspected
  HTTPS GET/POST rows and `proxy_action=tunnel-setup ssl_bump=peek` on CONNECT setup
  rows, while SOF-ELK® keeps plain combined proxy logs and Splunk JSON gets
  `ssl_bump_action`. The proxy parser and format schema understand the optional metadata
  tail, and the emitter no longer lets future active-tunnel state suppress an earlier
  CONNECT setup row. Automated eval passed at 96/100 over 92630 records, parseability
  remained 100/100, focused proxy/parser tests passed (`75 passed`), config validation
  passed, and full local verification passed (`4717 passed, 19 skipped`). The hard probe
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-316/hard_probe_proxy_https_inspection_metadata.json`
  found 1497 inspected HTTPS rows with 0 missing `ssl-inspect`/`bump`, 340 CONNECT setup
  rows with 0 missing `peek`, 0 inspected rows without recent setup, and 0 proxy parse
  errors. Blind scores were Threat Hunter 43, Detection Engineer 44, Network Forensics
  43, and Host/EDR 56, average 46.5; deliberation was not triggered. The proxy HTTPS
  semantic issue did not recur. Next target candidates are proxy client/user-agent
  identity stability, repeated generic web/proxy asset skeletons and scanner UAs,
  workstation maintenance/Sysmon event-family uniformity, perimeter TLS imperfection,
  and Linux/syslog/proxy burst statefulness.

- Loop 317 fixed proxy client/User-Agent identity stability. Generated full browser
  User-Agents now collapse through a source-sticky proxy identity helper, including
  CDN/subresource requests and baseline browser-session traffic, while explicit tool
  and authored User-Agents remain intact. Automated eval passed at 96.51212004785118
  over 92398 records, parseability remained 100/100, focused proxy/baseline tests
  passed (`205 passed, 1 skipped`), and full local verification passed
  (`4723 passed, 19 skipped`). The hard probe
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-317/hard_probe_proxy_user_agent_stability.json`
  found 2699 proxy rows, 0 parse errors, 26 source/second groups with multiple
  User-Agents, 2 groups with more than two UA families, and max 3 distinct UA
  families in one source/second. Blind scores were Threat Hunter 38, Detection
  Engineer 34, Network Forensics 34, and Host/EDR 44, average 37.5; deliberation
  was not triggered. The prior same-source same-second server/proxy UA burst issue
  did not recur as a major finding. Next target is eCAR SSH `USER_SESSION` lifecycle
  field consistency: preserve `session_id`, `logon_id`, source IP, source port, and
  username across paired LOGIN/LOGOUT rows, then address public web external UA/path
  diversity and Windows 4625 failure-mode texture.

- Loop 318 fixed eCAR SSH `USER_SESSION` lifecycle identity at the SSH action bundle
  and canonical session state layers. Unmanaged SSH bundle executions now create a
  canonical session identity, use the resolved `logon_id` across LOGIN/LOGOUT and
  source-timing seeds, and write Linux logind `session_id` back to state so later
  generic logoff paths preserve the same identity; `StateManager.get_session_object_id`
  now also resolves aliases and recently ended sessions. Automated eval passed at
  95.95333291230318 over 188044 records, parseability remained 100/100, focused
  lifecycle tests passed (`174 passed`), and full local verification passed
  (`4724 passed, 19 skipped`). The hard probe
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-318/hard_probe_ecar_ssh_session_lifecycle.json`
  found 135 SSH `USER_SESSION` rows with 0 missing LOGIN/LOGOUT `logon_id`, 0 missing
  LOGIN/LOGOUT `session_id`, 0 paired field mismatches, and 0 multi-value identity
  groups; 6 complete identity-bearing LOGOUT rows remained unmatched by in-window
  LOGIN rows, consistent with slice-of-time collection. Blind scores were Threat
  Hunter 32, Detection Engineer 28, Network Forensics 28, and Host/EDR 36, average
  31.0. Deliberation triggered for verdict disagreement and ended at average 30.5,
  with Host/EDR revising to Real. The prior SSH session identity issue did not recur.
  Next target is Linux syslog/eCAR companion contracts for dbus
  `hostname1`/`locale1`/`timedate1`/`resolve1` activity and `timedatectl`/polkit
  process evidence.

- Loop 319 fixed Linux dbus/polkit syslog and eCAR companion contracts. Dbus
  activation noise is now lower weighted and capped per host/window in
  `extra_syslog_messages.yaml`, and polkit action messages that name concrete
  command-line tools (`timedatectl`, `systemctl`, `pkcon`, `nmcli`) now materialize
  compatible eCAR `PROCESS` evidence before rendering the syslog `unix-process`
  PID. Automated eval passed at 96.49059004592698 over 183761 records, parseability
  remained 100/100, focused Linux system-traffic tests passed (`61 passed`), Ruff
  checks passed, and full local verification passed (`4726 passed, 19 skipped`).
  The hard probe
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-319/hard_probe_linux_dbus_polkit_companions.json`
  found 51 dbus activation rows, 0 dbus burst groups, 12 polkit action rows with
  process paths, and 0 missing eCAR process companions. Blind scores were Threat
  Hunter 28, Detection Engineer 24, Network Forensics 34, and Host/EDR 28, average
  28.5; deliberation triggered for verdict disagreement and reconciled to Real at
  average 27.0. The prior Linux dbus/polkit issue did not recur. Next target is
  proxy/DNS/HTTP transaction texture: repeated HTTP response sizes, compact
  proxy/TLS vocabulary, and weak transaction-level linkage between CONNECT rows,
  origin-side SNI, and DNS cache evidence.

- Loop 320 fixed HTTP document transfer-size texture at the shared HTTP content
  and baseline browsing-session layers. A new transfer-static resource check keeps
  immutable assets, health endpoints, and downloads byte-stable while allowing HTML
  document transfers to vary by session; persona, affinity, and inbound web-server
  browsing sessions now include the session timestamp in `transfer_variant_key`.
  Automated eval passed at 96.37171538391951 over 184608 records, parseability
  remained 100/100, focused HTTP/session tests passed (`65 passed` plus targeted
  baseline/proxy tests), Ruff checks passed, and full local verification passed
  (`4728 passed, 19 skipped`). The hard probe
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-320/hard_probe_proxy_http_transaction_texture.json`
  reduced the max exact non-health page-document response-size cluster from 44 to
  4 while preserving static asset reuse. The first blind-panel attempt was
  invalidated after a reviewer accidentally modified generated data; reports were
  moved to `invalid-contaminated-panel/`, data was regenerated, and the clean rerun
  passed a 79-file SHA-256 before/after data-integrity check. Clean blind scores
  were Threat Hunter 26, Detection Engineer 18, Network Forensics 24, and Host/EDR
  40, average 27.0; deliberation triggered for verdict disagreement and reconciled
  to Real at average 28.0. The repeated HTTP object-size issue did not recur as a
  network finding. Next target is SSH destination endpoint/source timing: eCAR
  `sshd` child process creation should not systematically precede syslog
  `Connection from` without explicit varied source-latency modeling.

- Loop 321 fixed SSH destination endpoint/source timing at the SSH action bundle
  and generic SSH preauth layers. SSH `Connection from` syslog now anchors at
  transport accept time while accepted/PAM/logind rows still wait for endpoint
  FLOW visibility; tuple responder processes are materialized from the same
  deterministic connection-start jitter as the canonical transport. The hard
  probe
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-321/hard_probe_ssh_destination_timing.json`
  reduced negative eCAR sshd-process-vs-syslog-connection offsets from 68/72
  matched rows to 0/68. Automated eval passed at 96.08943284310241 over 183974
  records, parseability remained 100/100, focused SSH tests passed (`22 passed`),
  and Ruff checks passed. The first blind-panel attempt was invalidated after a
  post-panel hash check detected `zeek-dmz/ocsp.json` changed; data was regenerated
  and the clean rerun passed an 80-file SHA-256 before/after data-integrity check.
  Clean blind scores were Threat Hunter 30, Detection Engineer 28, Network
  Forensics 59, and Host/EDR 28, average 36.25, with final clean-panel verdict
  Real. The prior systematic SSH destination timing issue did not recur. Next
  target is duplicate SSH endpoint lineage: one login can produce two near-identical
  `sshd: <user> [priv]` eCAR child processes before the shell while syslog ties
  the session to only one PID.

- Loop 322 fixed duplicate SSH endpoint lineage in the visible-shell bootstrap
  path. `ensure_linux_ssh_session_shell()` now reuses the SSH action bundle's
  tuple-scoped responder process from `ActiveSession.transport_pid` as the shell
  parent when it is still a matching `/usr/sbin/sshd` `sshd: <user> [priv]`
  process, instead of always materializing a second near-identical SSH priv
  child. The hard probe
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-322/hard_probe_duplicate_ssh_priv_children.json`
  reduced duplicate SSH priv clusters with shell children from 12 to 0. Automated
  eval passed at 96.02516303602455 over 188589 records, parseability remained
  100/100, focused SSH/world-model tests passed, Ruff checks passed, and full
  local verification passed (`4729 passed, 19 skipped`). The clean blind panel
  passed an 80-file SHA-256 before/after data-integrity check and scored Threat
  Hunter 52, Detection Engineer 42, Network Forensics 54, and Host/EDR 68,
  average 54.0, with final stance Inconclusive after Host/EDR found a stronger
  user-session lifecycle contradiction. The prior duplicate SSH shell-parenting
  issue did not recur. Next target is post-logout authenticated endpoint/proxy
  activity: `WS-OHADDAD-01` logs out `omar.haddad` and then emits eCAR Firefox
  proxy flows plus authenticated proxy rows as the same user seconds later.

- Loop 323 fixed post-logout authenticated proxy/user browsing activity at the
  baseline browser-session and proxy-auth attribution layers. Browser session
  requests now carry a `latest_request_time`, baseline persona browsing skips
  offsets after the planned session deadline instead of clamping them to logout,
  and proxy username attribution requires an active same-host interactive/RDP/SSH
  session at request time. The hard probe

  reduced authenticated proxy rows after visible logout from 96 to 0 and eCAR
  same-user flow rows from 22 to 2; the remaining two rows are SSH FLOW lifecycle
  texture, not proxy auth. Automated eval passed at 96.21349513015599 over
  178508 records, parseability remained 100/100, Ruff checks passed, and full
  local verification passed (`4731 passed, 19 skipped`). The clean blind panel
  passed a SHA-256 before/after data-integrity check and scored Threat Hunter 39,
  Detection Engineer 38, Network Forensics 27, and Host/EDR 31, average 33.75,
  with final stance Inconclusive/real-leaning and no hard contradictions. Next
  target is DB-PROD-01 database listener eCAR attribution: inbound MySQL/TDS/
  PostgreSQL FLOW rows are high-volume but lack database process/principal
  identity while comparable SSH/proxy/DC listener families are attributed.

- Loop 324 fixed DB-PROD-01 database listener eCAR attribution and database
  service compatibility at the world-model, baseline-planning, and system-process
  seeding layers. Database service labels now normalize through one shared rule,
  DB listener processes (`mysqld`, `postgres`, `sqlservr`) are seeded from host
  service inventory, database profile traffic is filtered to engines actually
  supported by the target host, and seeded DB daemons are protected from stale
  termination. The hard probe
  `scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/loop-324/hard_probe_db_listener_ecar_attribution.json`
  reduced DB-PROD-01 successful inbound DB eCAR FLOW rows from 539 bare rows
  across ports 1433/3306/5432 to 300 current-data rows on port 3306, with 298
  attributed and 2 bare. Automated eval passed at 95.59008216061706 over 91227
  records, parseability remained 100/100, acceptance passed, focused tests
  passed, Ruff checks passed, and full local verification passed (`4738 passed,
  19 skipped`). The clean blind panel passed a SHA-256 before/after
  data-integrity check and scored Threat Hunter 39, Detection Engineer 28,
  Network Forensics 74, and Host/EDR 66, average 51.75, with final stance
  synthetic-leaning mixed panel. Per user instruction, the assessment run is
  paused after this loop. If resumed, the next target is perimeter/firewall
  policy enforcement and denied-path rendering: ASA/Zeek currently show built
  paths that scenario policy says should be denied, and explicit denied direct
  DC-to-C2 attempts are absent.

## How to Continue

1. Start from the current `dev` state and read `TODO.md` for durable priorities.
2. Select the next assessment target from the latest verified blind-review or
  hard-probe findings.
3. Fix the owning layer, not an emitter symptom, unless the defect is truly
  source-local rendering.
4. Verify with focused tests, `uv run eforge validate-config`, Ruff checks, and
  normal `uv run pytest --no-cov` unless the loop specifically requires slow
   coverage.
5. Record only the concise loop outcome, next target, and validation result here.

## References

- `TODO.md` keeps the durable backlog.
- `CHANGELOG.md` keeps release history.
- Loop artifacts should remain in their scenario or temporary assessment output
  directories and be referenced here when needed.
