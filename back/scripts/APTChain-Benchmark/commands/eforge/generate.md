# EvidenceForge Log Generator

You are helping the user generate synthetic security log datasets from an EvidenceForge scenario YAML file using the `eforge` CLI.

## Quick Start

If the user has a scenario file ready:

```bash
eforge validate scenarios/<slug>/scenario.yaml
eforge generate scenarios/<slug>/scenario.yaml --verbose --force
```

Default to `eforge` for all CLI execution. If `eforge` is not found and you are
in an EvidenceForge source checkout, retry the same command with
`uv run eforge ...`.

If they don't have a scenario file yet, suggest using `/eforge scenario` to create one first.

## Command Reference

### eforge validate

Checks schema and cross-references without generating any logs. Fast — use this to catch issues before committing to a full generation run.

```bash
eforge validate <scenario.yaml>
```

Exit codes:
- 0 = Valid
- 1 = YAML parse error or file I/O error
- 2 = Schema or cross-reference validation error

### eforge generate

Generates log files from a validated scenario.

```bash
eforge generate <scenario.yaml> [options]

Options:
  --output, -o <dir>     Override the bundle root for generated reports and data.
                         By default, current eforge writes beside the scenario file.
  --formats, -F <list>   Comma-separated format filter. Only generates formats present in both
                         this list and the scenario's output.logs. Supports group names (zeek,
                         windows) and individual format names (zeek_conn, cisco_asa). Use
                         `eforge info format_groups` to see available groups. Example:
                         `eforge generate scenario.yaml --formats zeek_conn,zeek_dns` to
                         generate only Zeek connection and DNS logs.
  --target <name>        Output target: default or sof-elk. The default target is SIEM-neutral.
                         Use sof-elk when generating SOF-ELK®-compatible file layouts.
  --force, -f            Overwrite existing output without prompting
  --verbose, -v          INFO-level logging
  --debug, -d            DEBUG-level logging
  --oob-host <host>      LIVE-CALLBACK out-of-band testing for adversarial_payload events:
                         register an operator-controlled host (Burp Collaborator /
                         interactsh / sinkhole) so a vulnerable target calls back to YOU.
                         Must be a concrete registrable domain (e.g. oast.fun) or an IP
                         literal. Replaces the inert canary; allowlists your fuzzer
                         payloads. Repeatable. Passing it is the explicit opt-in. NEVER
                         pass --oob-host unless the user explicitly asks for live/OOB
                         callback testing against systems they are authorized to test.
                         Off by default — payloads use the inert, non-resolving canary
                         `canary.eforge.invalid`; EvidenceForge writes payload text only
                         and never executes it or calls out during generation.
```

Exit codes:
- 0 = Success
- 1 = Input error (file not found, bad path)
- 2 = Schema validation failed
- 3 = User declined overwrite (aborted)
- 21 = Generation error
- 130 = User interrupted (Ctrl+C)

## Workflow

### 1. Pre-flight Check

Before running generation:
- Verify the scenario file exists and is valid YAML
- Read the scenario to understand what will be generated (users, systems, time window, formats)
- Run `eforge validate <scenario-file>` to catch issues early
- Give the user a brief summary: "This will generate ~X hours of logs for Y users across Z formats"

### 2. Run Generation

```bash
eforge generate scenarios/<slug>/scenario.yaml --verbose --force
```

Always use `--verbose` so you can see progress and diagnose issues. Always use `--force` to skip the interactive overwrite prompt — without it, re-running a scenario will block waiting for user input.

For the canonical skill-created layout, the scenario file is `scenarios/<slug>/scenario.yaml` and generation writes to the same scenario root. If the user has a legacy flat scenario file directly under `scenarios/`, recommend moving it into the bundle root before generating. Use `--output <dir>` only when the user explicitly requests a nonstandard bundle root.

The output target never changes the directory path. `--target default|sof-elk` changes source-native file rendering inside the bundle and writes `OUTPUT_TARGET.txt`; it must not create target-named directories.

**Warm-up phase:** Generation begins with a warm-up period (default 8 hours, minimum 1 hour, configurable via `time_window.warmup`). During warm-up, the engine runs baseline generation to pre-populate DNS cache, process trees, active sessions, and other internal state — but warm-up events are **not** written to output files. This ensures the first minutes of output look like a running system rather than a cold start. Progress output distinguishes the warm-up phase from real generation.

Scenario-local `environment.network_identities` are applied in memory during
generation before package DNS, so authored host/IP ownership is shared by
baseline affinities, storyline events, DNS, HTTP, TLS/SNI, proxy, Zeek, firewall,
and endpoint flow rendering. `baseline_activity.traffic_affinities` produce
baseline traffic only; they should not appear as storyline or red-herring leads
in the generated ground truth.

Generated fallback identities are deterministic but data-driven. Baseline email
domains/local-parts, public mail replacement domains, omitted storyline external
IP pools, suspicious-benign DNS/connection targets, and command URL/host
placeholders come from overlay-aware files under `activity/`. Inspect them with
`eforge info identity_pools` and validate overlays with `eforge validate-config`.
The generator still never calls an LLM.

Generation writes log files to a `data/` subdirectory alongside the scenario file:

```
scenarios/<scenario-name>/
  scenario.yaml          ← input
  ENVIRONMENT.md         ← created by /eforge scenario
  ARTIFACTS_MANIFEST.json ← generated artifact manifest, when artifacts exist
  artifacts/             ← generated sidecar artifacts and optional authored collateral
    email/
      <artifact-id>.eml
  GROUND_TRUTH.md        ← generated human-readable answer key (baseline-only runs
                           still include the standard "no malicious events" report)
  GROUND_TRUTH.json      ← generated canonical machine-readable ground-truth document;
                           written for every successful run and used to derive
                           GROUND_TRUTH.md（schema v2；报告导入事件可包含
                           source_metadata 来源与补全披露）
  GOLD_Label.json        ← compact private attack-ID sets grouped by ATT&CK v18.1
                           tactic number and ordered storyline step
  OBSERVATION_MANIFEST.json ← generated source-observation manifest for eval
  RECORD_GROUND_TRUTH.jsonl ← generated instructor-only physical-record labels
                              and provenance
  OUTPUT_TARGET.txt      ← "default" or "sof-elk"
  data/                  ← generated log files
    <host>/
      windows_event_security.xml      ← default target Windows Security
      windows_event_sysmon.xml        ← default target Sysmon
      syslog.log                      ← default target Linux syslog
      <year>/
        windows_event_security_snare.log ← sof-elk target Windows Security
        windows_event_sysmon_snare.log   ← sof-elk target Sysmon
        syslog.log                       ← sof-elk target Linux syslog
    zeek/
      conn.json
      dns.json
      smtp.json
      files.json
    ...
```

If generated output (`data/`, `GROUND_TRUTH.md`, `GROUND_TRUTH.json`, `GOLD_Label.json`, `OBSERVATION_MANIFEST.json`, `RECORD_GROUND_TRUTH.jsonl`, `ARTIFACTS_MANIFEST.json`, `OUTPUT_TARGET.txt`, or `artifacts/`) already exists, the CLI prompts before overwriting. Use `--force` to skip the prompt (for automation / AI use). `ENVIRONMENT.md` is scenario-authored and is preserved.

### 3. Post-Generation

After successful generation:
- List the generated files and their sizes
- Check that expected formats were produced
- Note that `GROUND_TRUTH.json`, `GROUND_TRUTH.md`, `GOLD_Label.json`, `OBSERVATION_MANIFEST.json`, `RECORD_GROUND_TRUTH.jsonl`, optional `ARTIFACTS_MANIFEST.json`, `OUTPUT_TARGET.txt`, and `data/` were generated under `scenarios/<slug>/`. `GROUND_TRUTH.json` is the canonical semantic-event report (schema v2)；报告导入事件可携带 `source_metadata`，`GROUND_TRUTH.md` 会生成中文的来源/AI 补全披露章节。Schema-v3 `RECORD_GROUND_TRUTH.jsonl` maps every final physical record to its logical event, label, exact byte locator/content hash, native IDs, observed time, source-specific correlation/audit features, and `detectability_class` (`direct`, `association_required`, `provenance_only`, or `not_applicable`) with its reason and required public anchor types. `GOLD_Label.json` has exactly three sections (`ta_physical_ids`, `physical_id_set`, and ordered `storyline_attack_steps`) and deliberately does not duplicate path/index/byte locators. Generation validates attribution, final on-disk bytes, and GOLD-label consistency before publishing these sidecars. Keep all instructor-only sidecars out of blind-test bundles. For baseline-only runs, `GROUND_TRUTH.md` explicitly says no malicious events were generated.
- `ENVIRONMENT.md` (created by `/eforge scenario`) is already in the same directory — no copying needed
- Email artifact metadata is written to top-level `ARTIFACTS_MANIFEST.json` under `email.messages` when `environment.email.artifacts` enables modeled message metadata; `.eml` files are written under `artifacts/email/` according to artifact mode, and plaintext SMTP MIME parts can also appear in Zeek `files.json`. The manifest is production-facing, records blind-safe `artifact_export_status` / `artifact_export_reason` values for materialized and metadata-only rows, and omits storyline IDs, exercise verdict labels, and local filesystem paths; use `GROUND_TRUTH.json` for scenario correlation.
- Note that the causal expansion engine auto-generates prerequisite events (DNS lookups before connections, auth/session-bundle validation, Kerberos/DC-bundle TGT/TGS evidence before domain logons, Windows-audit-bundle events from command patterns, etc.) — these appear in the logs but are not explicitly listed in the scenario YAML
- Summarize the output for the user

### 4. Diagnose Errors

If generation fails, diagnose based on exit code and error output:

**Exit 2 — Schema Validation Failed:**

Try to fix simple issues directly — typos in hostnames, missing cross-references you can infer, obvious YAML formatting problems. Read the scenario file, fix the issue, and re-run `eforge validate` to confirm.

Common simple fixes:
- "references undefined persona" → Add the persona to the `personas:` section or use a pre-built one from `personas/`
- "references undefined system" → Check hostname spelling in user.primary_system or storyline.system
- "references undefined user" → Check username spelling in system.assigned_user or group.members
- "Duplicate username/hostname/IP" → Find and rename the duplicate
- "references undefined actor" → Storyline actor must be a defined username, a well-known built-in account such as `SYSTEM`, `root`, or `www-data`, or a name listed in `environment.service_accounts`
- "references undefined segment" → Check segment names in sensor.monitoring_segments

For structural problems that require rethinking the scenario design — like a fundamentally broken network topology, missing personas that need custom definitions, or a storyline that references systems/users that don't exist and can't be trivially added — advise the user to revisit with `/eforge scenario` to rework that section.

If generation succeeds but the output looks implausible, inspect the environment metadata before blaming the engine. Missing or vague `user.primary_system`, `system.roles`, and `system.services` often degrade session placement, infrastructure selection, and remote-session realism even when validation passes.

Read the full error output — validation issues include the field path and often a suggestion for how to fix it.

**Exit 1 — Input Error:**
- File not found → Check the path
- Permission denied → Check file permissions
- Invalid YAML syntax → Look for indentation errors, missing quotes, or bad characters

**Exit 21 — Generation Error:**
- Usually an internal error — read the traceback
- Try with `--debug` for more detail

### 5. Suggest Improvements

After reviewing output, you can suggest:
- Adding more log formats for better coverage
- Adjusting baseline intensity if the noise-to-signal ratio seems too low or high
- Adding network topology for more realistic network log generation
- Spacing out attack events for more realism

## Available Log Formats

| Format | Description | Generated For |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| windows | Windows Event Logs — default target XML, SOF-ELK target Snare syslog. Security (30 event IDs) + Sysmon (Events 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 22) | Windows systems |
| zeek | Zeek logs (NDJSON) — conn/dns/http/smtp/ssl/files/ntp per sensor | Network connections via `type: network` sensors |
| ecar | Simulated EDR telemetry using the eCAR record format (NDJSON) — PROCESS, FILE, FLOW, REGISTRY, MODULE, USER_SESSION | Any OS (optional EDR layer) |
| syslog | Linux syslog — default target RFC5424 flat per-host, SOF-ELK target RFC3164/BSD per-host/year | Linux systems |
| bash_history | Bash command history | Linux systems |
| snort_alert | Snort/Suricata alerts (fast format) | Network IDS via sensors |
| cisco_asa | Cisco ASA firewall syslog — default target flat per-firewall, SOF-ELK target per-firewall/year | Firewall entries (`type: firewall`) |
| web_access | Apache/Nginx combined access logs | Web servers |
| proxy_access | HTTP forward proxy access logs (Apache/Nginx combined) | Forward proxy systems |

When `nat_rules` are configured on the firewall sensor, `cisco_asa.log`
also includes 305011/305012 NAT translation records alongside the normal
Built/Teardown connection records.

`environment.network.sensors` is optional for host-only, web-only, or
proxy-only output. If `output.logs` requests `zeek`, concrete `zeek_*`,
`snort_alert`, or `cisco_asa`, the scenario must define a matching
`type: network`, `type: ids`, or `type: firewall` entry. `proxy_access` is
generated from systems with `roles: [forward_proxy]`, not from network sensors.

Use the `/eforge:references:evidence-formats` skill for detailed field documentation, output paths, and known limitations for each format.

## Performance Expectations

- Runtime scales with emitted evidence volume, selected formats, scenario length, warm-up
  length, host count, and traffic rates. Web/proxy-heavy scenarios can emit many dependent
  requests per top-level action.
- For long scenarios, scope `output.logs` or use `--formats` to generate only the sources
  needed for the exercise.
- The engine uses parallel threaded emitters — one thread per log format
- If a run slows down progressively by hour, capture the scenario and generated format mix;
  that usually points to a generator hot path rather than normal output-volume scaling.
